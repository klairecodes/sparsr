1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,460
But the solar system's maintaining it equally at 3.6 amps, okay, at 28.2 volts, okay.

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,660
So 100 watt hours and inside the house we're drawing 42, I'm trying to see why we're drawing

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,660
42.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,160
Oh, people charging laptops and shit?

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,160
Maybe.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,160
Okay.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,020
So I'm going to turn on semi-green inverter, my lovely 50 hertz inverter with this.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,260
This is the 50 hertz inverter?

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,260
Yeah.

10
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,260
The 3000 watt monstrosity?

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,260
Yeah.

12
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:32,740
And it's a, you know, if you had good ratings, I'd just say the Trenum M started the wrong

13
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,740
thing in the wrong place.

14
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:44,140
If you look at the bottom of it, so, so now generators are off, the inverter floating

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,700
boat barely went up like a tenth of an amp, okay, because it was rated to have pretty

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,360
good, you know, you know, parasitic load when there's no load.

17
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,200
So what exactly is this box?

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
This is the solar charge.

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
That's the solar charge control.

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
Okay.

21
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,200
So solar power.

22
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
That's all the brains.

23
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,200
So the solar power comes in from up there, so this conduit up to there, brings underground.

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,560
I also have other wires going out there.

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,200
I actually have a AC outlet up there in that box, just to run like telescopes and things.

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
Gotcha.

27
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,120
And right now it comes from the main generator.

28
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,120
I want to move this to semi-green, okay.

29
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,120
This is semi-green.

30
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,120
That's semi-green.

31
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,680
That's semi-green.

32
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,000
This is green near me, no, this is actually, that's that green.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,440
This is the solar panel.

34
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,360
You basically leave this on unless you're servicing the batteries, okay.

35
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,360
Okay.

36
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,200
By the way, the way these switches are, these DC shut-off high-amp switches is horizontal

37
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,200
is on.

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,280
So, for example, I just turned on the big interval at times, I turned it off, it will

39
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:58,560
squeal at death-dye, okay, as this big, massive capacitor slowly gives it a go.

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
And that's that.

41
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,280
And that turns off all the parasitic load.

42
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,160
There actually is a remote, like RJ45, that I can turn it on, but it, but it all it does,

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,080
and all of them are this way, all it does is, it's a fast on-off, it reduces it, but

44
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,280
turns off the power, but there is a parasitic load.

45
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,280
Gotcha.

46
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,840
I'll put it back on, we'll have it on for the day.

47
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,280
That means the lights in the bathroom and the bedroom will work on semi-green, because

48
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,400
all the new outlets I put in are on semi-green, okay.

49
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,440
So semi-green is on, then this is battery disconnect, you always leave it on unless

50
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,240
you're servicing the batteries, okay.

51
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:41,680
So when I leave camp, when I leave camp, I turn this off, this off, in the summer I

52
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,920
flip this down to on always, this is the DC power to this, okay.

53
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,920
Okay.

54
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,360
One of the things I want to do is replace, I have a lot of low power fuses on everything,

55
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,200
like these, I want to put this block in somewhere and make a nice fuse block, okay.

56
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,900
It's a fuse block for my low amperage.

57
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:04,200
So I have a fuse going over to the fridge in there, I have, this thing is fused, because

58
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:11,360
this is not a Halana amperage, so he comes up here, and then if I flip this, if I, so

59
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:19,920
with semi-green, and before I had solar, if I turn this timer here, and then I flip this

60
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,880
up to timer, it stays on, okay.

61
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,720
But now when this timer times out, it will turn off this inverter and turn off super

62
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
green.

63
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
Got it.

64
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
Okay.

65
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,120
And, and I actually have the, you know, sort of die here, okay.

66
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,280
But super green can basically just stay on all the time.

67
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,120
Well, yeah, well, it can stay on all the time, you know, one thing, the circuits still on

68
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:48,680
the super green are the light above the desk, the light above the kitchen sink, and, and

69
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,800
the gadget charging station on the stairs, because those outlets were run for, I am going

70
00:03:52,800 --> 00:04:00,720
to move those circuits, except for the desk itself, to super green, semi-green, I mean,

71
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,720
okay.

72
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,600
So this is super green from this inverter, comes to here, and this is just an AC status

73
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,080
thing that you plug in, you can unplug it, and it turns out off, that's all about it.

74
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,400
Okay, so that just reads, that just reads like output?

75
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,400
That just reads output, and what it is, there is a shunt here.

76
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,840
This is a shunt coil, AC shunt coil that measures my amperage.

77
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,000
So this, notice this goes into there.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,240
So this is just, you know, so I'm trying to, I mean, put this together, okay.

79
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
Yeah.

80
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Amazon.

81
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,240
Okay.

82
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,760
They, they, they, um, so that's, that's that, and then obviously if I unplug this, this is

83
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,560
just, you know, yeah, and, and it's low, low current, you know, and, and, and, uh,

84
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,720
so when I'm here by myself, I often just run on this alone.

85
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
Gotcha.

86
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,720
Okay.

87
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
So let's see.

88
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,960
The output from this guy goes all the way, and then into here, into here, then this goes

89
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,000
out over to, oh, goes, goes, actually goes to an outlet in the garage where much, okay.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,440
So in the garage, so this is, this is, um, um, I have two big circuits.

91
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:08,960
I have a 240 volt, uh, three, uh, split phase circuit going from the big generator straight

92
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
into the house.

93
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Okay.

94
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
Into the garage.

95
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,960
Okay.

96
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,960
Oh, we're going to the garage.

97
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,960
So let me finish out here.

98
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,960
Sure.

99
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Uh, actually let's go in the garage.

100
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,960
I'll explain the panels there and what I want to do there.

101
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
And then I'll come out and spray.

102
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,560
How that's all of this shit's why it is with those relays that pretty out.

103
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
Okay.

104
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
Okay.

105
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:39,160
So coming in from the garage, that is the, uh, that big fat wire is, is, is the, uh,

106
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,680
128, 240, a split phase.

107
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,440
It comes to this main panel here.

108
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,440
Okay.

109
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,560
Actually it comes to this.

110
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,240
When I turn on this generator, which I will do right now, I have a switch here.

111
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,240
Okay.

112
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,960
So the big, the big generator starting electric start, the water system turns it on.

113
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,960
Okay.

114
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,960
This turns it on.

115
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,960
That's the 6,000 watt one.

116
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
One, two, three.

117
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,960
Clunk.

118
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
Clunk.

119
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
Time to lay relay in there.

120
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Okay.

121
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
With a timer inside.

122
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
I melt that.

123
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
And that means I'm not cranking against load.

124
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
Gotcha.

125
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
Okay.

126
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
Okay.

127
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,960
When the pump calls.

128
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,960
Okay.

129
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
And then it comes into this sub panel.

130
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
Okay.

131
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:22,160
Now what it does do is, um, this, this, this circuit is a 30 amp circuit going to be the

132
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,000
power into the house where I have another panel.

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,480
This is actually the master panel, a sub panel in the basement.

134
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,160
This was one of the first circuits I put in the place when I put the generator in.

135
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,440
And, and so this, this, that, the outlets in the house from the early days just came

136
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,440
off of this.

137
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,400
Uh, uh, uh, I've moved a number of those circuits to a green panel in the basement.

138
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
I'll show you that in a bit.

139
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Cool.

140
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,560
That is now going to be semi-green.

141
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,840
Well, super green just goes straight from there.

142
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,440
There is no circuit breaker because the fuse on the, the fuse on the inverter will blow.

143
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
Okay.

144
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,080
And that little inverter, this is semi-green.

145
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,520
Semi-green actually goes from a, so I'm going to go back and explain to you semi-green because

146
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,680
I do have a circuit breaker panel there, um, uh, under that inverter.

147
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,800
But I also, um, there's also, uh, it will pull from the generator circuit.

148
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,440
I'll, I'll go explain the generators connection to all this later.

149
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,400
This is circuit number six, uh, uh, so here off of this circuit, it seems like.

150
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,840
Uh, lights in here over there and light in that outlet over there.

151
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,840
Gotcha.

152
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,080
Uh, uh, there's just an outlet up here and that's, and that runs off of super green.

153
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,600
No, that, well, right now it's off generator only.

154
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Okay.

155
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
That's all the generator out there.

156
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
I'm going to order all the super green.

157
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,600
Semi-green.

158
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Okay.

159
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Semi-green is.

160
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Semi-green is, semi-green is kind of a goal.

161
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,800
The semi-green is a goal for everything because you can get high current either 3001 inverter

162
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,640
or if a generator is running.

163
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,640
Yeah.

164
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,640
Okay.

165
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,640
Generator straight.

166
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,640
Okay.

167
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,800
So the generator is so that the battery charger out there, which also runs off of generators

168
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
only.

169
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Okay.

170
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,600
The battery charger that sits there, feet, either the, either the small little portable

171
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,800
or the big generator, whenever a generator is running, the battery charger will put battery

172
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,120
charge on the batteries, but you're not drawing from the batteries at the same time.

173
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,520
So the inverter, so the batteries will charge up faster.

174
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
Cool.

175
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
Okay.

176
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,120
Cause I, you know, uh, uh, and so rather than a lot of people make off grid source systems

177
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,720
that the generator sold job is to charge batteries.

178
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
Okay.

179
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,960
And, and then your, your inverter is always providing continuous power 24 by seven and,

180
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,320
and with the new inverter charger I can have, it will actually have an inverter charger.

181
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:36,280
And I may actually go to that, that will start to gen, the big generator when necessary,

182
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,480
especially if the battery charger is more than the 25 amp 24 volt charger I have out

183
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
now.

184
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,760
You can get like a 50 amp one that can put a pretty fast charge to generator, don't

185
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,480
have to run a huge amount of time.

186
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
Okay.

187
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
So that's an option.

188
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,320
I may rewire that when I replace that, that, that 50 Hertz thing.

189
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:59,120
But so super green, super green when I wired this, before I had this, I wired super green

190
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,880
in from here and it wasn't called super green.

191
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,360
It was on my 1500 watt 12 volt inverter before the one I had before, but switch to 24 volt

192
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
last year.

193
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
Right.

194
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
I remember that.

195
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
Okay.

196
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:17,960
So, so, uh, but I just moved the existing solar circuit over to, uh, uh, super green

197
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:23,120
and then now I'm, I'm, I'm making semi green when I added this new 3000 watt inverter.

198
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,280
So this is the only semi green outlet here.

199
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,520
This is a full charger timer and it turns right now, it's on super green.

200
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,520
That charges these.

201
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,920
I'm going to move this to this and make more outlets out here on this.

202
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,880
Wait, you got tool charge on super green?

203
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,560
It was because it was the original, it was the original 12 volt system, which was a 1500

204
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
watt.

205
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,680
I still have that inverter in a box somewhere.

206
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,680
Okay.

207
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,240
I have, I have a complete 12 volt setup in boxes and actually, you know, somebody wants

208
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:54,200
a real small 12 volt setup, everything, but the panels, the, uh, so believe it or not,

209
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,840
uh, uh, then when we organize the garage this summer, we put all these, I used to have these

210
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
in the house and everything.

211
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,840
Yeah.

212
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,120
Uh, we put them all on this circuit and believe it or not, charging a bunch of these batteries

213
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,200
plus running the thing is too much for super green.

214
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
So yeah.

215
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,920
I'll probably keep one super green outlet out here.

216
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,760
I'll probably swap this to be super green and this to be, uh, semi-green.

217
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:27,120
And then over here, generator only air compressor, I'll probably keep it on generator only.

218
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,120
Okay.

219
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,080
You know, the, uh, you know, the, I don't know, I'd not have a generator, but the lights

220
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,280
and even the tool outlet over there, I'm going to, I'm going to move this.

221
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,280
Okay.

222
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:41,440
So that one is the lights and tool outlet over here and that one is currently on generator.

223
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,080
Uh, this is add comes right into the, this is a Jane generator panel.

224
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,080
Okay.

225
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,440
And that guy is the compressor plus generator lights.

226
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
All right.

227
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,360
Now let me go back over to where the generator, and by the way, one circuit comes out of here,

228
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,480
uh, uh, and the circuit coming out of here goes up to here to the compressor circuit and

229
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,840
then goes back to the generator so that when the generator is running, so I have it, and

230
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:12,600
it goes through a 15 amp, uh, uh, 15 amp breaker to code and back to the generator, the generator

231
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:20,080
takes whatever the generator is running, it adds the ability, uh, to charge its own battery

232
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,080
from AC.

233
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,080
Okay.

234
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:32,000
And, but so, so the circuit, this circuit here, yeah, comes from the garage.

235
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Okay.

236
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,200
Okay, this is output, this is from 120 volt from the garage on the right.

237
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Okay.

238
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,760
And by the way, that home wire is the two-wire start circuit.

239
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,760
Oh, sick.

240
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,760
Okay.

241
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,320
Cause that's just a 12 volt on the battery.

242
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

243
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,600
Now in here, this is, let's say this thing totally shits the bed.

244
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Yeah.

245
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,800
I get a big sort of heavy duty 240 volt portable generator and I flip this double breaker in

246
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,000
one direction on from backup generator.

247
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Okay.

248
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Generic.

249
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Come over here, emergency gen backup, plug in there using this cord.

250
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Okay.

251
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Okay.

252
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And a manual start, but, and I put this in long ago when I put the generator.

253
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah, yeah.

254
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,480
Now, more recently, since I do want to have charge, I put an input in here from 1000 watt

255
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,640
or 2000 watt right now, it's a 2000 watt.

256
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,960
And this is input from my semi-green portable.

257
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:39,680
So these either the big generator or this input, this is an input, okay, from here.

258
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,680
From here.

259
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,680
Okay.

260
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,680
So this is where the, this is where.

261
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,680
I ran this all last night.

262
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,680
Right.

263
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,680
This is super quiet.

264
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,080
It's got a low RPM and burner mode.

265
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,080
Okay.

266
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,080
We can run all night if necessary.

267
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,720
Or if I, if it's a cloudy day and I'm telecommuting, it's not super noisy like this and a lot less

268
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,720
wear and tear on a big machine.

269
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
Yeah.

270
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
This is 6kW.

271
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,000
And I run it, when it's running super efficient, it's putting out about a half a kW.

272
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,680
But it's enough to run the battery charger.

273
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,680
Gotcha.

274
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:10,200
And by the way, because of the cloudy, that panel feeds 12 volts through this PWM solar

275
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,000
charge controller that feeds back through here, comes back through that red and black

276
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:28,160
wire into here to keep that battery charge, okay, because, don't put that switch off in

277
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,160
the garage in the generator, we don't need it on.

278
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,160
Switch on the garage.

279
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
Okay.

280
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
Let's see if I can remember this.

281
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,600
There's one, wait.

282
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,600
Which one?

283
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,000
Fuck.

284
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Compressor switch.

285
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh, right, right, right, right, right.

286
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh, enabled disable.

287
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Gotcha.

288
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Okay.

289
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Made a noise.

290
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,480
So there's one, two, three switches in here, plus that dial.

291
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,480
All right.

292
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,480
Fuck.

293
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
This is complicated.

294
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,480
This is so complicated.

295
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
I know.

296
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,480
Oh, here.

297
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
Okay.

298
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,480
Has a computer.

299
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
Computer.

300
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
This thing sucks, right?

301
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,480
Yeah.

302
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:12,480
Well, it, it, it runs everything, but it's a parasitic load of about 8 watts.

303
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,480
8 watts.

304
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
Off the battery.

305
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,760
If I'm here by myself in the generator and hardly runs, this battery goes down.

306
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,920
So the, but right now this battery is fully charged.

307
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,640
This measures the charge level on that battery.

308
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
Okay.

309
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,080
It's a totally separate, and these go straight to that little 100 watt panel on the bottom

310
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
of there.

311
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,320
That's solar in and coming from load out.

312
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
This goes back.

313
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,600
So this also feeds in, in here.

314
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,240
This, no, this, yeah, this goes into here, a 12 volt, oh, that's the negative.

315
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
I'm sorry.

316
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,240
That's the negative here.

317
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,560
So this, oh yeah, the red for this actually goes down to charge this.

318
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,640
So if, if I'm running any generator, this actually will add a more charge.

319
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,160
This is such a slow charger.

320
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,000
This is designed for home standby, meaning you've got utility.

321
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You've got utility.

322
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,480
You've got utility.

323
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,720
This computer has its own little very low current battery charger to keep the battery

324
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,720
topped off.

325
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,440
The generator is running, the generator is keeping the battery topped off, so the battery

326
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,440
is always topped off.

327
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Yeah.

328
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,440
We don't have fucking utility.

329
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
Okay.

330
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,920
So if the generator is off and there's no power, otherwise I think this computer will

331
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,080
kill it over the course of four days.

332
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,080
Been there, done that.

333
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,080
Yeah.

334
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,080
Okay.

335
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,080
And that fucking blows.

336
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,640
And so, so I have this whole separate system with its own battery charge.

337
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,120
So this is a complete, you know, completely separate battery charger right there.

338
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,600
Battery charger, solar charge controller, solar panel, and battery, you know.

339
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,600
And hopefully the idea is that the eight watts from there is outweighed by that hundred

340
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
watts there.

341
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Over the course of 24 hours.

342
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
Okay.

343
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,360
But if I, you know, but the nice thing is if I run either that or this, this goes off.

344
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
Got it.

345
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Okay.

346
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,720
Like, like for example, notice it was on and flashing.

347
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
Yeah.

348
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,720
But.

349
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Did I have gas?

350
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
Get a little bit.

351
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
I'm gonna have to.

352
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Oh, did it run out overnight?

353
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
No, it didn't.

354
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
All right.

355
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:18,120
So the relays in there will prep, this will preempt this and either this or this will

356
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,760
preempt the solar charge controller on semi-green.

357
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,760
On semi-green.

358
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
Okay.

359
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,880
So yeah, I'm going to top it off tonight because we may have to run it tonight depending

360
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
on what we do.

361
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,160
The interesting about it is I can turn, we can let people turn on all the lights inside

362
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,120
the bedrooms off with that band and then plug in all their gadgets onto the semi-green

363
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
circuit.

364
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,120
That's what I'm saying.

365
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,120
Charge your phones in your bedrooms.

366
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
Yeah.

367
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,120
Okay.

368
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
Not in the charge.

369
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,440
Because the charge station is super green, which is purely solar and solar is not happening

370
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,440
right now.

371
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,800
It's not only purely solar battery, but it's only 300 watts.

372
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Right.

373
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,120
Because it would, it's heritage dates to.

374
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
Yeah.

375
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,720
All these fucking phones now use like 15 watt chargers and shit and like 30 watt chargers.

376
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,880
Well they quickly dropped down to a much lower current weight.

377
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:10,720
It's glass tops, dead glass tops, five dead glass tops will blow out the super green.

378
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,600
And so you said that there was a fuse attached to the super green and that's like not a reusable

379
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
fuse.

380
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
That just like.

381
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Yeah.

382
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
It's actually, it's on the inverter itself.

383
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Cool.

384
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Okay.

385
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,600
Yeah.

386
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,600
And I have blown that.

387
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,280
Actually what happens is half the time the thing goes beep and shuts off.

388
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,000
Ah, cause it'll, it'll smart enough to recognize that it's over current and it'll peace out.

389
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,320
But it, you know, the nice thing is, is that super green is enough with my very low current

390
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,880
and that's why I got the Euro.

391
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,120
My brother Jeff installed the Nero and this, the one you helped survey and I was looking

392
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,120
at his power consumption.

393
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,120
I go, fuck.

394
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
And that's why I got it.

395
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:56,200
I mean, I gave up a lot of networking functionality like VLANs and, you know, it does now port

396
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
in.

397
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
So let me put this on now.

398
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,200
On.

399
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
Yeah.

400
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:14,200
Sometimes when you start these things and then you turn them on for me.

401
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:25,640
So now, now what is happening is, um, that charger's on.

402
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,520
Right now everything's happy and fully charged.

403
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,520
Yeah.

404
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
The sun is happy.

405
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,520
That charger says fully charged.

406
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:41,520
So, but power is coming from there through here, into here, by the way, that has its

407
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
own overload protection.

408
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,520
So it's not directly fused.

409
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,520
Okay.

410
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,520
That generator.

411
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,520
Gotcha.

412
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
Okay.

413
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,920
But when it comes through the big generator comes from the 15 amp fuse on.

414
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,000
So semi green is 15 amps.

415
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So that's like 1800 watts.

416
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Okay, it's a single circuit, not really to code, you know, got too many outlets on it

417
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
with you.

418
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Okay.

419
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:10,200
So the battery charger's charging, but and, and, uh, semi green inverter is on and, you

420
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,480
know, so everything's in the house.

421
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,080
So semi green inverters not have any load because this green, this, this breaker here,

422
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:25,720
the preamp should relay, uh, from, uh, Jenset preamp and then over here is semi green Jenset

423
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,220
preamp solar.

424
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:34,600
So basically if both generators, the big one, the 15 amp circuit that comes back from the

425
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:41,240
garage from the big generator, the, the circuit from that small plug, yeah, coming to this

426
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,560
relay, if the big generator runs, now if I put your hand on here.

427
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,560
Okay.

428
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,560
What am I supposed to feel?

429
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,560
What?

430
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,560
Listen.

431
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,560
Wait.

432
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,560
Oh, okay.

433
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,560
Okay.

434
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,560
It switched to the big generator.

435
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,560
Yeah.

436
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,560
Okay.

437
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
After the generator started.

438
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,560
Okay.

439
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
Okay.

440
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,560
Put your hand back on it.

441
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,560
Where's this?

442
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,560
Where's my indicator light?

443
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,560
So.

444
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,560
That's on generator.

445
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,560
Over here.

446
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,560
Okay.

447
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:17,560
Now it's on the little generator.

448
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,560
Okay.

449
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
Okay.

450
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,560
Go turn.

451
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
Uh, hang on.

452
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,560
I'm just going to plug it here.

453
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,560
Uh, what?

454
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,560
Take a look.

455
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,560
Okay.

456
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,560
I'm going to plug in the generator.

457
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,560
Oh.

458
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,560
Now it's on the little generator.

459
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,560
Okay.

460
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
Okay.

461
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,560
Okay.

462
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,560
Go turn.

463
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
Uh, hang on.

464
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,560
I'm just going to plug it here.

465
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
Uh.

466
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,560
I'm going to plug in the generator.

467
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,560
Oh.

468
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,560
Now it's on inverter.

469
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,560
Yeah.

470
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,560
Yeah.

471
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,560
Yeah.

472
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
50 fucking hertz.

473
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,560
Okay.

474
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
Okay.

475
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,560
Uh, uh, isn't that nice?

476
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,560
Yeah.

477
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,560
That's fucking sick.

478
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,560
Okay.

479
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,560
I'm plugging it back in.

480
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,560
Okay.

481
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,560
So what exactly is this device?

482
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,560
So this is a two pole, uh, uh, two pole, uh, uh, relay.

483
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,560
Two pole relay.

484
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,560
Okay.

485
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
And this is the same thing.

486
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,560
Okay.

487
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,560
Gotcha.

488
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,560
So literally like what happens is.

489
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,560
What's that big electrical?

490
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,560
That's big.

491
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,560
Granger supply.

492
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,560
Granger supply.

493
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
Okay.

494
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,560
Awesome.

495
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,560
Awesome.

496
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
Awesome.

497
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
Yeah.

498
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,560
For sure.

499
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,560
Okay.

500
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
So, so if I understand this correctly, like you've got like the, the, the arm of the relay,

501
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,560
right?

502
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,560
Like hooked up to.

503
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,560
Normally closed in one direction.

504
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
Right.

505
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,560
Normally closed in one direction.

506
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,560
And then when, when power is.

507
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,560
Normally closed for everything means it's going to pull from here.

508
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,560
Right.

509
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,560
Power from, from, from, from big generator hits here.

510
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,560
Yeah.

511
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,560
So power from big generator here, here it switches it to big generator.

512
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,560
Yeah.

513
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,560
Okay.

514
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
So what power comes into here?

515
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,560
It then goes to here.

516
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:42,060
If power comes from here, it's the fault node is with no power called to the, to the coil

517
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,360
is from inverter, but when any generator is running, this one flips.

518
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,560
So you feel this one flip in either case, you get a flicker.

519
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
Okay.

520
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,560
Okay.

521
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
So the, the.

522
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:58,560
So now I'm just running the big generator for no fucking reason.

523
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:03,560
Fucking hell.

524
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:08,560
And I'm going to turn off.

525
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,560
This is a 22 minute long video.

526
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,560
Oh, I heard a, I heard a click.

527
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:21,560
So now the, now this boy's off back on this guy and this guy pulls from batteries.

528
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,560
Yeah.

529
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,560
That pulls from the batteries, which is of course charged by that big fuck off thing over

530
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,560
there.

531
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,560
So if the summer, believe it or not, I can, you know, if I have a well good summer, summer

532
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,560
day, I just leave some green on and the generators only runs on the pump and I don't need the

533
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,560
portable.

534
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
Okay.

535
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,560
You know, and if I actually added a little bit more batteries would be better, but I've

536
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,560
got 800 amp hours.

537
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,240
I'll get you there in a second.

538
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,560
So that's basically this circuitry here.

539
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,560
Okay.

540
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,560
Let's go and take a look at the basement.

541
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
Sweet.

542
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
Parasig load.

543
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
Yeah.

544
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:00,560
From a distance, you can tell the generator's running, but I chase every person.

545
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,560
Oh, for sure.

546
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,560
100%.

547
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,560
100%.

548
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,560
One more quick question.

549
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,560
What?

550
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,560
So this 15 watt panel right here, that, that charges a battery in here.

551
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,560
One of those, just one of those little batteries.

552
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
I had two of them here.

553
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,560
My old hundred watt system had two of these big batteries.

554
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,560
The other one was totally shot.

555
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,560
I turned it in.

556
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,560
It just maintains.

557
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,560
So, you know, if, if a lead acid battery goes too dead, it can freeze and damage.

558
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,560
It's like fucked.

559
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,560
Okay.

560
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,560
And apparently it gets a long time for a big battery like that to go bad.

561
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,560
It would last a couple of years, but yeah.

562
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,560
I heard you said 20 years at some point.

563
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,560
Well it freezing weather.

564
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,560
You know, not good.

565
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:37,800
That's why like when your car goes dead, the winter and you leave your battery dead and

566
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:43,560
you let it freeze, because all the sulfur is on the plate and that water in the battery.

567
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,560
Yeah.

568
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,560
Especially a flooded battery.

569
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,560
So you got to fucking buy a new battery.

570
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,560
Yeah.

571
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,560
Refurbish the battery.

572
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,560
Yeah.

573
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:54,560
I think there's one behind the wood.

574
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,560
Have you recorded what this does?

575
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,560
Turn it on for Wi-Fi.

576
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,560
Yeah.

577
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,560
That was towards the beginning.

578
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,560
Okay.

579
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,560
I got something.

580
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,560
But yeah.

581
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,560
Okay.

582
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,560
Okay.

583
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,560
Right.

584
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,560
Yeah.

585
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,560
Yeah.

586
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,560
Yeah.

587
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,560
I remember that.

588
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,560
It's like a simple idiot.

589
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,560
Yeah.

590
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,560
Thanks.

591
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,560
Okay.

592
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,560
Okay.

593
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,560
Okay.

594
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,560
Okay.

595
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,560
Okay.

596
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,560
Yeah.

597
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,560
Okay.

598
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,560
Okay.

599
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,560
Yeah.

600
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,560
Okay.

601
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,560
Yeah.

602
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,560
Yeah.

603
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,560
That's what we're done here.

604
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,560
I gotta send it.

605
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,560
I hope it's fine.

606
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,560
Don't break a leg.

607
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,560
Again.

608
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,560
Bozo.

609
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,560
That bozo broken ankle.

610
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,560
So in here, this was last summer.

611
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,560
Last summer?

612
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,560
A year ago.

613
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,560
Oh shit.

614
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,560
Son.

615
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,560
We got stacks on stacks.

616
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,560
Yeah.

617
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,560
So this assembles.

618
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,560
Okay.

619
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,560
This is gravity fed.

620
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,560
I built this with a river a year ago this summer.

621
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,560
And at the same time, Connor and I put those 400 watt panels over the garage.

622
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,560
Right.

623
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,560
And that had, I had the, I only had to buy one more.

624
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,560
I had three left over from my old original 12 volt setup.

625
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,560
Yeah.

626
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:04,560
And then this is also a preemptive, this actually actually preemptive circuitry built in.

627
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,560
I bought this to replace that fridge.

628
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
Right.

629
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:12,560
Whatever any generator runs.

630
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,560
Okay.

631
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,560
This comes off.

632
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,560
So this comes off.

633
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,560
This turns on the fridge.

634
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,560
Okay.

635
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,560
That's the fridge.

636
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,560
This is actually a two pole switch.

637
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,560
Yeah.

638
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,560
So it'll switch both the 24 volts straight from the batteries.

639
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,560
And this comes from one of the fuses in there.

640
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,560
24 volts.

641
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,560
And, and so a cigarette ladder, but it's 24 volts.

642
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,560
Wait.

643
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,560
So this is a truckers fridge.

644
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,560
You put this in a semi-track.

645
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,560
Most trucks are truckers.

646
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,560
They semi-track.

647
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,560
He has this for his cold stuff in the, in the back of his, your super cap.

648
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,560
Arguably the most important switch in the camp is that one.

649
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560
Cause that's the beer fridge.

650
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,560
You got it.

651
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
Especially in the summer.

652
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
So yeah.

653
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
Okay.

654
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,560
And actually, actually it's actually great because I can turn the temperature down

655
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,560
to freeze.

656
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
And, and it'll be a freezer.

657
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
Nice.

658
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,560
And it's highly efficient.

659
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,560
Yeah.

660
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,560
And then the summer, the solar runs it.

661
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,560
Okay.

662
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,560
Awesome.

663
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Okay.

664
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,560
And then whenever the generator runs it preempts to the generator.

665
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,560
And it had that, it had the preempts in certain cases.

666
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,560
Okay.

667
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,560
Just because.

668
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
Okay.

669
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,560
Okay.

670
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,560
Okay.

671
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,560
So in other words, obviously, you know, the, the, the, you know, the trucker doesn't

672
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,560
want his truck batteries to go dead and he can't start the fucking truck.

673
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:20,560
So, you know, the, uh, so, uh, yeah, you know, the, not cheap, but $700.

674
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,560
But, uh, yeah.

675
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,560
Oh.

676
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,560
Yeah.

677
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,560
This was a major improvement here.

678
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,560
So.

679
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,560
Nice.

680
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
Very cool.

681
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,560
Um, so these batteries kind of pool with the batteries outside.

682
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,560
No, those batteries outside aren't even used anymore.

683
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,560
Okay.

684
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,560
So those batteries.

685
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,560
They're locked over from a 12 volt system.

686
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,560
Gotcha.

687
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,560
All right.

688
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
These are the batteries.

689
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,560
I just, I just want that other, other big one is still pretty good.

690
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,560
Okay.

691
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
What do you use?

692
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
Is it when you're not using that for anything?

693
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,560
I'm not using it for anything, but it could be part of that 12 volt system I give to

694
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,560
somebody.

695
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,560
Okay.

696
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,560
Okay.

697
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,560
I don't know the parts for the 12 volt system in here.

698
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,560
Ah, this is the, this is the previous gen.

699
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,560
This is what gen, gen two.

700
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,560
Gen one.

701
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,560
Gen one.

702
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,560
What, what gen are we on right now?

703
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,560
So.

704
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,560
Are we on gen two?

705
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
We're probably two and a half.

706
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,560
Gen two and a half.

707
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,560
Okay.

708
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,560
So here's my 1000 watt inverter right here.

709
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,560
Okay.

710
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
That's the 1000 watt inverter.

711
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
Yeah.

712
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,560
12 volts.

713
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,560
12 volt.

714
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,560
1000 watt inverter.

715
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,560
Not interchangeable.

716
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,560
And I have a solar, what I have.

717
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,560
Actually, I have a 100, 100 watt small inverter.

718
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,560
Oh, this is the 20 per volt one.

719
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,560
I have an extra 20 per one in case that super green one fails.

720
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,560
Right.

721
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,560
And I have a 12 volt one as well.

722
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
So yeah.

723
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,560
Cool.

724
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,560
So I have, this is enough.

725
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,560
I have enough to make other than the solar panels to make a complete 12 volt system.

726
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,560
Yeah.

727
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:37,560
That somebody, somebody who's just here in the summer and has like a very lightweight

728
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,560
internet service like, like my arrow.

729
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,560
Yeah.

730
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,560
You know, and they're not here in the winter.

731
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,560
That could be more than enough for, you know, probably I would just run with four panels

732
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,560
and that inverter, one or two of those bat batteries.

733
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,560
Sure.

734
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,560
And they'd be good to go.

735
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,560
Nice.

736
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,560
And so remind me, why did you switch to 24 volt?

737
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
Fatness of wires.

738
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,560
Fatness of wires.

739
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,560
Okay.

740
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,560
The what, the 12 volt wire is coming.

741
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,560
Oh, they're coming from behind.

742
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,560
This is this.

743
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,560
And even these are slightly underrated, but I don't, I don't, since I'm not running,

744
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,560
you know, I don't draw 3,000 watts.

745
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,560
Yeah.

746
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,560
Okay.

747
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,560
And it can take a surge.

748
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:14,560
But technically this should be, this is, I think four out gauge.

749
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,560
I think it should be, I think four out gauge.

750
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:26,560
I think it should be two or one odd four, which is like, and, and if I were 12 volt,

751
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,560
it would have to be just fucking and just managing and dealing with it.

752
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,560
They're, they're distance lengths and there's calculations, what you have to have.

753
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,560
Yeah.

754
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:40,560
And, and, and ideally, you know, I can get double the power if I just switched to 48

755
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,560
volt and I wouldn't even need to change these wires.

756
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,560
Okay.

757
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:48,560
And I just rewire these.

758
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,560
So these are 12 volt batteries, two banks, each in parallel.

759
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,560
And also, I'll show you how I will draw it on paper because I can show you.

760
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,560
Yes, please.

761
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,560
Okay.

762
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,560
Yeah.

763
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,560
I've got a, I got a sketchbook.

764
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,560
We can, we can do it in there.

765
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,560
It's like actually proper.

766
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,560
You're filming that you're going to be watching this.

767
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,560
This is a 29 minute long video Potter.

768
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,560
Oh, yeah.

769
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,560
Oh, yeah.

770
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,560
Oh, I'll show you the base.

771
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,560
Okay.

772
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:22,560
That's just, just a selection of distribution and it needs a lot.

773
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,560
I did some rework this summer.

774
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,560
Okay.

775
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:31,560
Like all the new wiring we put in to, to, to house helped and a whole bunch of CSU just

776
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,560
helped me wire crawling under the camp.

777
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,560
Also, you know, during the middle of the season.

778
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,560
Fuck.

779
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,560
Was that bad?

780
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,560
That was bad.

781
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,560
Wasn't it?

782
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,560
It was pretty rough.

783
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
It was still fun.

784
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,560
All right.

785
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,560
Yeah.

786
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,560
Okay.

787
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:51,560
I have a light on super green that turns on some, you know, LED lights there.

788
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,560
Yeah.

789
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,560
So this is basement light on a timer, always.

790
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
Timers for everything.

791
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,560
More fucking time.

792
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,560
This is the main sub panel from the generator.

793
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,560
Okay.

794
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,560
Okay.

795
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,560
Okay.

796
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,560
And I've got a bunch of newsbreakers here that I put them in.

797
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,560
I think I was going to wire the whole house from the main generator.

798
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,560
I'll probably never use all these circuits, but there they are.

799
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,560
There you have them.

800
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,560
Okay.

801
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,560
This is a 240 volt circuit going to the water pump system.

802
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,560
This boy?

803
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,560
Yeah.

804
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,560
Okay.

805
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,560
So interesting for the water pump system it had to do with the generator.

806
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:25,560
This is a two pole start switch for switch the, so switch the 240 volts with phase.

807
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,560
Yeah.

808
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,560
Normally at a well, you would run 240 volt in and out and it would click on and off the

809
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,560
pump as needed at a house.

810
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
Okay.

811
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
With utility.

812
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,560
The problem is I need to use one of the poles of this.

813
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,560
Yeah.

814
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,560
It's just a two pole switch.

815
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,560
Okay.

816
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,560
And if I push on this right here.

817
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,560
What are you pushing on?

818
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
Click.

819
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560
Click.

820
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,560
I just went out of water.

821
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,560
Now.

822
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,560
Timer goes.

823
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:55,560
It's pumping.

824
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,560
I just forced it to pump.

825
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
Yeah.

826
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,560
It's almost full so it's going to start off any minute, but that turned on that.

827
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
That plugged into Gen-O-Me.

828
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,560
Notice I labeled that Gen-O-Me?

829
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,560
Gen-O-Me.

830
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,560
Okay.

831
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,560
And I noticed I labeled that one up there super green.

832
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,560
Super green.

833
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:15,560
And I didn't, that's a new little distribution box up there that moved some of the wires

834
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:20,560
from Gen to semi-green and super green.

835
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,560
So I have a split super green.

836
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,560
The upstairs outlet in the loft and in my bedroom is that four wire.

837
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,560
Okay.

838
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,560
So it takes both super green and semi-green upstairs.

839
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,560
The, well, it's full.

840
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,560
There you go.

841
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:44,560
So all of this, and by the way, so what it's this is, this is, so obviously I need a 12

842
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,560
volt circuit.

843
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,560
The 12 volt start circuit for the generator has to come through all this.

844
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,560
It comes all the way down to this switch.

845
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,560
Comes into here.

846
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,560
This switch disables it so the water can't start the generator.

847
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
Disable.

848
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,560
Disable.

849
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,560
And then if the generator is running, it would actually still get power.

850
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,560
Actually, no, it won't.

851
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
It won't get power.

852
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,560
But if you totally want it, you can turn off, this is a 240 volt breaker to the pump.

853
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,560
But normal operation, this is on.

854
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,560
This has been there since I put the generator in back in 2011.

855
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,560
Okay.

856
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,560
Okay.

857
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,560
And again, this is the start circuit.

858
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,560
This was the CAT 3 cable I stole from RIT.

859
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,560
Oh my fucking god.

860
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,560
Incredible.

861
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:28,560
But yeah, there's that.

862
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:33,560
And then I've been building out this new sub panel and he's on semi green.

863
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,560
Okay.

864
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,560
So he comes straight from the semi green.

865
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,560
And I use these extra, this actually was water pump wire.

866
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,560
So when I built the thing, I actually put a lot of extra wire in the conduit from the

867
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,560
garage to the house.

868
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,560
I have not had to put any new wires in.

869
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,560
So I have circuits.

870
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:54,560
I have cables for three separate sources of 120 volt power from the day I put the generator

871
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,560
in the garage.

872
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,560
Very nice.

873
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,560
Okay.

874
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,560
And it sat there unused.

875
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,560
And it's been very nice.

876
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,560
But right now I have.

877
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,560
So, so these are the new circuits we put in this summer that Klaus and the boys have

878
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,560
saved to help me with.

879
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,560
Danny and Lonnie.

880
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
Yeah.

881
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,560
Danny and Lonnie.

882
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,560
What did that say?

883
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,560
What did that say over there?

884
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:18,560
Basement, bathroom, kitchen, kitchen net.

885
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:23,560
But that actually is not hooked up yet.

886
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,560
Okay.

887
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,560
It will be.

888
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,560
I'm going to move the semi green kitchen.

889
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,560
Switch on the floor there.

890
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,560
That switch on the floor is coming off of super green only right now.

891
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,560
Okay.

892
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,560
I got to move that.

893
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,560
I moved that switch on the floor.

894
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
Actually, I'm actually going to rewire.

895
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,560
I'm going to wire up to those up above lights.

896
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,560
I like the indirect lights shining on the ceiling.

897
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,560
Yeah.

898
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
Okay.

899
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,560
Okay.

900
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,560
The makes a nice warm light in there.

901
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,560
I have to do more of those.

902
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:51,560
And so I'm going to just run super green to the desk with the internet and everything

903
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,560
else will be on semi green, especially once I get the right inverter going.

904
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:03,560
And then, but so the bathroom, I figured I was going to have a separate circuit.

905
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,560
What does this say?

906
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,560
15 amp.

907
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,560
I can't even read my writing there.

908
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,560
I'm terrible.

909
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,560
I'm already terrible.

910
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,560
You've got to get the label maker down here.

911
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,560
I know.

912
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,560
Yeah.

913
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,560
It doesn't stick.

914
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,560
You need a better label maker.

915
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,560
That label maker, they fall off.

916
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,560
Yeah.

917
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,560
They just suck.

918
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,560
Get the class label maker.

919
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,560
I don't know.

920
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,560
I used cheaply.

921
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,560
Fozo.

922
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,560
But yeah, this is just a basic soap panel.

923
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,560
And what happens is I bring three wires in, but I just bring the two hots together because

924
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,560
it's, this is actually, I'm only getting 15 amps.

925
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,560
Now let's, oh, one last thing I didn't show you.

926
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,560
Okay.

927
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,560
Over here.

928
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:53,560
But it's nice when I arrived in the summer and I disabled my water when I leave in the

929
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,560
summer just so that it doesn't actually start in pulp.

930
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,560
And I disabled my generator.

931
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,560
Yeah.

932
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,560
By the way, I didn't show you my disabled process.

933
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,560
I might as well show you that.

934
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,560
Sure.

935
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:10,560
So because we're in the garage, the most annoying thing about that computer generator, you're

936
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:20,560
gonna, you know, I already, Steve Green helped me fix the computer generator one time because

937
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:25,560
I had to put in Potter designed lightning protection.

938
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,560
Potter designed lightning protection.

939
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,560
Because the computer generator.

940
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,560
It's intense.

941
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,560
Computer was dried by a nearby lightning storm shortly after.

942
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,560
Oh, when was that?

943
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,560
Oh, it's a bunch of years ago.

944
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,560
Okay.

945
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:42,560
And it was after the warranty of the generator expired and $400 for a new fucking computer.

946
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,560
That blows chunks.

947
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:50,560
So here, when I leave camp, the Tarte circuit from house and everywhere comes through this

948
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,560
box that I designed.

949
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
What's in there?

950
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,560
It's a surge suppression circuit.

951
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,560
Switch on top.

952
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,560
Yeah.

953
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,560
That basically takes all the wire and shunts them to ground.

954
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,560
So here's an honor start for the generator.

955
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,560
I flipped this.

956
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,560
Nothing happened.

957
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,560
Okay.

958
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:13,560
The computer is still ready to run, but there's any lightning strikes that strikes the ground

959
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,560
and induces through the start circuit is not going to come through to the generator computer.

960
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,560
Okay.

961
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,560
Get pranked.

962
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,560
Okay.

963
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,560
So ready to run.

964
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
So this doesn't know it's not a source.

965
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,560
So I got no way to start.

966
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,560
I can go over here and push it to manual start, but it's on auto start.

967
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
Okay.

968
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,560
This putting it to the center position means I can turn this back on.

969
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
No startage.

970
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,560
It's on here.

971
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,560
Basically, all these start triggers are just hooked in parallel.

972
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,560
Sometimes where did I turn the generator?

973
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,560
Is the pump pumping?

974
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,560
Is it turned on in the kitchen?

975
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,560
Is it turned on in the garage?

976
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,560
Or is it turned on out here?

977
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,560
You've got to get like a status LED or some shit to like let you know.

978
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,560
Well, I do.

979
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,560
There's lights in various places.

980
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,560
We need like a whole switchboard, like a centralized switchboard somewhere.

981
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,560
But this is a surge suppression circuit and it has a solid state relay.

982
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:05,560
When I came up here, Steve Green, I had a solid state relay and it fried.

983
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,560
Which was not a bad thing.

984
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,560
It saved the generator.

985
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,560
Steve Green helped me wire this.

986
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,560
But so here's what happens is we'll go through my arrival routine.

987
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,560
So this is always slipped off when I leave camp.

988
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,560
Okay.

989
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,560
Just to ground everything.

990
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,560
Right.

991
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,560
But if the lightning strikes when I'm in camp, that circuitry probably protects me anyway.

992
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,560
Okay.

993
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,560
Yeah.

994
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,560
That surge suppression circuitry I bought.

995
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,560
So this off.

996
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:36,560
Now, this means the solar charge controller is still topping out the battery.

997
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,560
So no self-discharge.

998
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,560
And nothing will start to generator.

999
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,560
Okay.

1000
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,560
I arrive.

1001
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,560
This is on.

1002
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,560
First thing I come out here.

1003
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,560
You always see me come out here.

1004
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,560
Yeah, right.

1005
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,560
Okay.

1006
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,560
I come out here.

1007
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,560
Put it up.

1008
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,560
Put this on.

1009
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,560
On.

1010
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:58,560
I had to, there's a fuse here for the computer.

1011
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,560
Oh.

1012
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,560
Okay.

1013
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,560
Sure.

1014
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,560
I used to take out the fuse every time I left.

1015
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,560
I got pissed at that.

1016
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,560
So I wired the switch.

1017
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,560
You got a little switch boy.

1018
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,560
There's a fuse.

1019
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,560
Okay.

1020
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,560
It's a fuse.

1021
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,560
It's just, it's just like a 5 amp or 10 amp 12 volt fuse.

1022
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,560
Okay.

1023
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560
Okay.

1024
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,560
So turn this puppy on.

1025
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,560
Now look at the computer screen.

1026
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,560
Generator active install wizard.

1027
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,560
It's not ready to run.

1028
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,560
Okay.

1029
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,560
Oh my God.

1030
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,560
I didn't set the time right.

1031
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,560
What time is it?

1032
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,560
The time is currently in New York.

1033
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,560
It actually has stores and flash memory.

1034
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,560
It's run log.

1035
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,560
11.53.

1036
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,560
Okay.

1037
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,560
Enter.

1038
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,560
Good enough.

1039
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,560
Month.

1040
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,560
Deal 12.

1041
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,560
Today's the 27th.

1042
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,560
I did set that.

1043
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,560
Okay.

1044
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,560
Now I hit enter.

1045
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,560
Today's the 28th.

1046
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,560
28th.

1047
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,560
Oh well.

1048
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,560
Oh well.

1049
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,560
Fuck it.

1050
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,560
And there.

1051
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,560
Okay.

1052
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,560
Now it's ready to run.

1053
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,560
Why the fuck does your generator need a clock?

1054
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,560
Fuck it.

1055
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,560
And so I got to go through this.

1056
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,560
Now here's what's really bad.

1057
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,560
Okay.

1058
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,560
You're right here.

1059
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,560
It's 15 below.

1060
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,560
Oh shit.

1061
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,560
This LCD.

1062
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:07,560
It takes like five minutes for the digits to show.

1063
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,560
With your fingers fucking freezing.

1064
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,560
And I want a fucking digger shot.

1065
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,560
I got a fucking deal.

1066
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,560
But there it is.

1067
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,560
And now we're ready to run.

1068
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,560
And it will start.

1069
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,560
Why didn't it start?

1070
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,560
Enter.

1071
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,560
Why is that not a run?

1072
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,560
Oh did you switch?

1073
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,560
Oh I did.

1074
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,560
I know.

1075
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,560
Oh yeah.

1076
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,560
I did put it in.

1077
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,560
Thank you.

1078
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,560
So that's that.

1079
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:46,560
And then I apparently changed the oil and oil filter and service and motor.

1080
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,560
Okay.

1081
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,560
Damn sheesh.

1082
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,560
Okay.

1083
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,560
So now you've seen the basement.

1084
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,560
Did I close up the basement door?

1085
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,560
You like shut it.

1086
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,560
I don't know if there's like a latch or anything.

1087
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,560
No, no, no.

1088
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,560
Did I close it?

1089
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,560
No.

1090
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,560
No.

1091
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,560
No.

1092
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,560
No.

1093
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,560
No.

1094
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,560
No.

1095
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,560
No.

1096
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,560
No.

1097
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,560
No.

1098
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,560
No.

1099
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,560
No.

1100
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,560
No.

1101
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,560
No.

1102
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,560
No.

1103
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,560
No.

1104
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,560
No.

1105
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,560
No.

1106
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,560
No.

1107
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,560
No.

1108
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,560
No.

1109
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,560
Yes.

1110
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,560
Yes.

1111
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,560
No.

1112
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,560
No oh.

1113
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,560
Oh.

1114
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,560
Celine.

1115
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,560
No.

1116
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,560
No.

1117
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,560
No.

1118
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,560
No.

1119
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,560
No.

1120
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,560
No.

1121
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,560
No.

1122
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,560
No.

1123
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,560
No.

1124
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,560
No.

1125
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,560
No.

1126
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,560
No.

1127
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,560
No.

1128
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,560
No.

1129
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,560
Oh.

1130
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,560
No.

1131
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,560
No.

1132
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,560
No.

1133
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,560
No.

1134
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,560
No.

1135
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,560
No.

1136
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,560
No.

1137
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,560
No.

1138
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,560
And they're professionally done by professionals that charge $20,000.

1139
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,560
But that's fucking boring.

1140
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,560
Well, yeah.

1141
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,560
Well, the...

1142
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,560
So now, yeah.

1143
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,560
So I've got a few wiring down here to change the circuits going over there.

1144
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,560
I do want, you know, so that obviously...

1145
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,560
So the inverter's on.

1146
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,560
Oh yeah, you can see this.

1147
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,560
So the inverter's on.

1148
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,560
Okay, I got 3,000 watts.

1149
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,560
Okay.

1150
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,560
By the way, these are like light activated, so if you...

1151
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,560
Have you got close to them?

1152
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,560
Yeah, well, if you cover up that little sensor.

1153
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,560
Yeah, yeah.

1154
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,560
And when it's still enough light.

1155
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,560
So this is...

1156
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,560
I can run my desk on super green alone.

1157
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,560
It's kind of nice.

1158
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,560
Just the desk, okay?

1159
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,560
Sure.

1160
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,560
The desk area.

1161
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,560
The microwave's running, okay?

1162
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,560
And what's that running on right now?

1163
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,560
It's running on the inverter.

1164
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,560
That's the inverter.

1165
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,560
It's running the generator on?

1166
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,560
It's draining the batteries.

1167
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,560
It was draining the batteries.

1168
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,560
No, not yet.

1169
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,560
Wait.

1170
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,560
The hammer.

1171
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,560
Notice the frequency change of the sound.

1172
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,560
Switch from 50 to 60.

1173
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,560
That time it actually worked.

1174
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,560
Sometimes it would go...

1175
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,560
I have a little UPS over here.

1176
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,560
You may...

1177
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,560
I probably had it.

1178
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,560
It would totally bonkers out to UPS.

1179
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,560
And that led me, like, into all sorts of confusion.

1180
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,560
Good name.

1181
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,560
So, yeah, so for example, the light upstairs can be turned on.

1182
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,560
The lights in the bedroom can be turned on.

1183
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,560
The lights in the bathroom can be turned on.

1184
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,560
And, you know, we're pretty charged.

1185
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:27,560
Probably out this evening I'll run the portable generator from dark until about 8.39 or shortly

1186
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,560
we could go to bed.

1187
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:33,560
I'll turn it off and the internet alone can run overnight.

1188
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,560
Just fine.

1189
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,560
Not a issue.

1190
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,560
Great.

1191
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,560
Off the batteries.

1192
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:44,560
And especially now that the nitro is going to be a bit warmer, the batteries will be

1193
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,560
able to get more productive.

1194
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,560
And that's the system.

1195
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,560
Okay, so now we want to draw things out.

1196
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,560
Or do we want to do something else?

1197
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,560
Oh, yeah.

1198
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,560
I can draw things out.

1199
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,560
What are people doing?

1200
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,560
People are just kind of doing their own thing.

1201
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:58,560
I'm thinking tomorrow when it's a bit warmer, we'll climb Baldy and have a picnic somewhere.

1202
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,560
Just that, bro.

1203
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,560
Okay.

1204
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,560
You've been continuously filming me.

1205
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,560
Yeah, this is a 43 minute video.

1206
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,560
Are we done with the...

1207
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,560
I think we're done with the video.

1208
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,560
All right, cool.

1209
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,560
Cool.

1210
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,560
Nice talking to you all.

1211
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,560
Yeah.

1212
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:39,560
Thank you for joining me too, by the way, for when some bozo finds us on gallery in 50 years.
