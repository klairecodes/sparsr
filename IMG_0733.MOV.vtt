WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.460
But the solar system's maintaining it equally at 3.6 amps, okay, at 28.2 volts, okay.

00:08.460 --> 00:13.660
So 100 watt hours and inside the house we're drawing 42, I'm trying to see why we're drawing

00:13.660 --> 00:14.660
42.

00:14.660 --> 00:16.160
Oh, people charging laptops and shit?

00:16.160 --> 00:17.160
Maybe.

00:17.160 --> 00:18.160
Okay.

00:18.160 --> 00:22.020
So I'm going to turn on semi-green inverter, my lovely 50 hertz inverter with this.

00:22.020 --> 00:23.260
This is the 50 hertz inverter?

00:23.260 --> 00:24.260
Yeah.

00:24.260 --> 00:25.260
The 3000 watt monstrosity?

00:25.260 --> 00:26.260
Yeah.

00:26.260 --> 00:32.740
And it's a, you know, if you had good ratings, I'd just say the Trenum M started the wrong

00:32.740 --> 00:33.740
thing in the wrong place.

00:33.740 --> 00:44.140
If you look at the bottom of it, so, so now generators are off, the inverter floating

00:44.140 --> 00:49.700
boat barely went up like a tenth of an amp, okay, because it was rated to have pretty

00:49.700 --> 00:54.360
good, you know, you know, parasitic load when there's no load.

00:54.360 --> 00:57.200
So what exactly is this box?

00:57.200 --> 00:58.200
This is the solar charge.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.200
That's the solar charge control.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.200
Okay.

01:00.200 --> 01:01.200
So solar power.

01:01.200 --> 01:02.200
That's all the brains.

01:02.200 --> 01:06.200
So the solar power comes in from up there, so this conduit up to there, brings underground.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.560
I also have other wires going out there.

01:08.560 --> 01:15.200
I actually have a AC outlet up there in that box, just to run like telescopes and things.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.200
Gotcha.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.120
And right now it comes from the main generator.

01:18.120 --> 01:21.120
I want to move this to semi-green, okay.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.120
This is semi-green.

01:22.120 --> 01:23.120
That's semi-green.

01:23.120 --> 01:27.680
That's semi-green.

01:27.680 --> 01:31.000
This is green near me, no, this is actually, that's that green.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.440
This is the solar panel.

01:32.440 --> 01:36.360
You basically leave this on unless you're servicing the batteries, okay.

01:36.360 --> 01:37.360
Okay.

01:37.360 --> 01:42.200
By the way, the way these switches are, these DC shut-off high-amp switches is horizontal

01:42.200 --> 01:43.200
is on.

01:43.200 --> 01:48.280
So, for example, I just turned on the big interval at times, I turned it off, it will

01:48.280 --> 01:58.560
squeal at death-dye, okay, as this big, massive capacitor slowly gives it a go.

01:58.560 --> 01:59.560
And that's that.

01:59.560 --> 02:01.280
And that turns off all the parasitic load.

02:01.280 --> 02:08.160
There actually is a remote, like RJ45, that I can turn it on, but it, but it all it does,

02:08.160 --> 02:13.080
and all of them are this way, all it does is, it's a fast on-off, it reduces it, but

02:13.080 --> 02:15.280
turns off the power, but there is a parasitic load.

02:15.280 --> 02:16.280
Gotcha.

02:16.280 --> 02:19.840
I'll put it back on, we'll have it on for the day.

02:19.840 --> 02:23.280
That means the lights in the bathroom and the bedroom will work on semi-green, because

02:23.280 --> 02:27.400
all the new outlets I put in are on semi-green, okay.

02:27.400 --> 02:32.440
So semi-green is on, then this is battery disconnect, you always leave it on unless

02:32.440 --> 02:34.240
you're servicing the batteries, okay.

02:34.240 --> 02:41.680
So when I leave camp, when I leave camp, I turn this off, this off, in the summer I

02:41.680 --> 02:46.920
flip this down to on always, this is the DC power to this, okay.

02:46.920 --> 02:47.920
Okay.

02:47.920 --> 02:51.360
One of the things I want to do is replace, I have a lot of low power fuses on everything,

02:51.360 --> 02:56.200
like these, I want to put this block in somewhere and make a nice fuse block, okay.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.900
It's a fuse block for my low amperage.

02:57.900 --> 03:04.200
So I have a fuse going over to the fridge in there, I have, this thing is fused, because

03:04.200 --> 03:11.360
this is not a Halana amperage, so he comes up here, and then if I flip this, if I, so

03:11.360 --> 03:19.920
with semi-green, and before I had solar, if I turn this timer here, and then I flip this

03:19.920 --> 03:22.880
up to timer, it stays on, okay.

03:22.880 --> 03:26.720
But now when this timer times out, it will turn off this inverter and turn off super

03:26.720 --> 03:27.720
green.

03:27.720 --> 03:28.720
Got it.

03:28.720 --> 03:29.720
Okay.

03:29.720 --> 03:33.120
And, and I actually have the, you know, sort of die here, okay.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.280
But super green can basically just stay on all the time.

03:35.280 --> 03:40.120
Well, yeah, well, it can stay on all the time, you know, one thing, the circuits still on

03:40.120 --> 03:48.680
the super green are the light above the desk, the light above the kitchen sink, and, and

03:48.680 --> 03:52.800
the gadget charging station on the stairs, because those outlets were run for, I am going

03:52.800 --> 04:00.720
to move those circuits, except for the desk itself, to super green, semi-green, I mean,

04:00.720 --> 04:01.720
okay.

04:01.720 --> 04:07.600
So this is super green from this inverter, comes to here, and this is just an AC status

04:07.600 --> 04:11.080
thing that you plug in, you can unplug it, and it turns out off, that's all about it.

04:11.080 --> 04:13.400
Okay, so that just reads, that just reads like output?

04:13.400 --> 04:17.400
That just reads output, and what it is, there is a shunt here.

04:17.400 --> 04:20.840
This is a shunt coil, AC shunt coil that measures my amperage.

04:20.840 --> 04:23.000
So this, notice this goes into there.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.240
So this is just, you know, so I'm trying to, I mean, put this together, okay.

04:26.240 --> 04:27.240
Yeah.

04:27.240 --> 04:28.240
Amazon.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.240
Okay.

04:29.240 --> 04:32.760
They, they, they, um, so that's, that's that, and then obviously if I unplug this, this is

04:32.760 --> 04:37.560
just, you know, yeah, and, and it's low, low current, you know, and, and, and, uh,

04:37.560 --> 04:40.720
so when I'm here by myself, I often just run on this alone.

04:40.720 --> 04:41.720
Gotcha.

04:41.720 --> 04:42.720
Okay.

04:42.720 --> 04:43.720
So let's see.

04:43.720 --> 04:48.960
The output from this guy goes all the way, and then into here, into here, then this goes

04:48.960 --> 04:54.000
out over to, oh, goes, goes, actually goes to an outlet in the garage where much, okay.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.440
So in the garage, so this is, this is, um, um, I have two big circuits.

05:00.440 --> 05:08.960
I have a 240 volt, uh, three, uh, split phase circuit going from the big generator straight

05:08.960 --> 05:09.960
into the house.

05:09.960 --> 05:10.960
Okay.

05:10.960 --> 05:11.960
Into the garage.

05:11.960 --> 05:12.960
Okay.

05:12.960 --> 05:13.960
Oh, we're going to the garage.

05:13.960 --> 05:14.960
So let me finish out here.

05:14.960 --> 05:15.960
Sure.

05:15.960 --> 05:16.960
Uh, actually let's go in the garage.

05:16.960 --> 05:17.960
I'll explain the panels there and what I want to do there.

05:17.960 --> 05:18.960
And then I'll come out and spray.

05:18.960 --> 05:22.560
How that's all of this shit's why it is with those relays that pretty out.

05:22.560 --> 05:23.560
Okay.

05:23.560 --> 05:24.560
Okay.

05:24.560 --> 05:39.160
So coming in from the garage, that is the, uh, that big fat wire is, is, is the, uh,

05:39.160 --> 05:41.680
128, 240, a split phase.

05:41.680 --> 05:44.440
It comes to this main panel here.

05:44.440 --> 05:45.440
Okay.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.560
Actually it comes to this.

05:47.560 --> 05:51.240
When I turn on this generator, which I will do right now, I have a switch here.

05:51.240 --> 05:52.240
Okay.

05:52.240 --> 05:55.960
So the big, the big generator starting electric start, the water system turns it on.

05:55.960 --> 05:56.960
Okay.

05:56.960 --> 05:57.960
This turns it on.

05:57.960 --> 05:58.960
That's the 6,000 watt one.

05:58.960 --> 05:59.960
One, two, three.

05:59.960 --> 06:00.960
Clunk.

06:00.960 --> 06:01.960
Clunk.

06:01.960 --> 06:02.960
Time to lay relay in there.

06:02.960 --> 06:03.960
Okay.

06:03.960 --> 06:04.960
With a timer inside.

06:04.960 --> 06:05.960
I melt that.

06:05.960 --> 06:06.960
And that means I'm not cranking against load.

06:06.960 --> 06:07.960
Gotcha.

06:07.960 --> 06:08.960
Okay.

06:08.960 --> 06:09.960
Okay.

06:09.960 --> 06:10.960
When the pump calls.

06:10.960 --> 06:11.960
Okay.

06:11.960 --> 06:12.960
And then it comes into this sub panel.

06:12.960 --> 06:13.960
Okay.

06:13.960 --> 06:22.160
Now what it does do is, um, this, this, this circuit is a 30 amp circuit going to be the

06:22.160 --> 06:24.000
power into the house where I have another panel.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.480
This is actually the master panel, a sub panel in the basement.

06:26.480 --> 06:30.160
This was one of the first circuits I put in the place when I put the generator in.

06:30.160 --> 06:33.440
And, and so this, this, that, the outlets in the house from the early days just came

06:33.440 --> 06:34.440
off of this.

06:34.440 --> 06:38.400
Uh, uh, uh, I've moved a number of those circuits to a green panel in the basement.

06:38.400 --> 06:39.400
I'll show you that in a bit.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.400
Cool.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.560
That is now going to be semi-green.

06:42.560 --> 06:45.840
Well, super green just goes straight from there.

06:45.840 --> 06:50.440
There is no circuit breaker because the fuse on the, the fuse on the inverter will blow.

06:50.440 --> 06:51.440
Okay.

06:51.440 --> 06:55.080
And that little inverter, this is semi-green.

06:55.080 --> 06:59.520
Semi-green actually goes from a, so I'm going to go back and explain to you semi-green because

06:59.520 --> 07:03.680
I do have a circuit breaker panel there, um, uh, under that inverter.

07:03.680 --> 07:10.800
But I also, um, there's also, uh, it will pull from the generator circuit.

07:10.800 --> 07:15.440
I'll, I'll go explain the generators connection to all this later.

07:15.440 --> 07:21.400
This is circuit number six, uh, uh, so here off of this circuit, it seems like.

07:21.400 --> 07:26.840
Uh, lights in here over there and light in that outlet over there.

07:26.840 --> 07:27.840
Gotcha.

07:27.840 --> 07:31.080
Uh, uh, there's just an outlet up here and that's, and that runs off of super green.

07:31.080 --> 07:33.600
No, that, well, right now it's off generator only.

07:33.600 --> 07:34.600
Okay.

07:34.600 --> 07:35.600
That's all the generator out there.

07:35.600 --> 07:36.600
I'm going to order all the super green.

07:36.600 --> 07:37.600
Semi-green.

07:37.600 --> 07:38.600
Okay.

07:38.600 --> 07:39.600
Semi-green is.

07:39.600 --> 07:40.600
Semi-green is, semi-green is kind of a goal.

07:40.600 --> 07:44.800
The semi-green is a goal for everything because you can get high current either 3001 inverter

07:44.800 --> 07:46.640
or if a generator is running.

07:46.640 --> 07:47.640
Yeah.

07:47.640 --> 07:48.640
Okay.

07:48.640 --> 07:49.640
Generator straight.

07:49.640 --> 07:50.640
Okay.

07:50.640 --> 07:55.800
So the generator is so that the battery charger out there, which also runs off of generators

07:55.800 --> 07:56.800
only.

07:56.800 --> 07:57.800
Okay.

07:57.800 --> 08:01.600
The battery charger that sits there, feet, either the, either the small little portable

08:01.600 --> 08:05.800
or the big generator, whenever a generator is running, the battery charger will put battery

08:05.800 --> 08:09.120
charge on the batteries, but you're not drawing from the batteries at the same time.

08:09.120 --> 08:11.520
So the inverter, so the batteries will charge up faster.

08:11.520 --> 08:12.520
Cool.

08:12.520 --> 08:13.520
Okay.

08:13.520 --> 08:17.120
Cause I, you know, uh, uh, and so rather than a lot of people make off grid source systems

08:17.120 --> 08:20.720
that the generator sold job is to charge batteries.

08:20.720 --> 08:21.720
Okay.

08:21.720 --> 08:26.960
And, and then your, your inverter is always providing continuous power 24 by seven and,

08:26.960 --> 08:31.320
and with the new inverter charger I can have, it will actually have an inverter charger.

08:31.320 --> 08:36.280
And I may actually go to that, that will start to gen, the big generator when necessary,

08:36.280 --> 08:41.480
especially if the battery charger is more than the 25 amp 24 volt charger I have out

08:41.480 --> 08:42.480
now.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.760
You can get like a 50 amp one that can put a pretty fast charge to generator, don't

08:45.760 --> 08:47.480
have to run a huge amount of time.

08:47.480 --> 08:48.480
Okay.

08:48.480 --> 08:49.480
So that's an option.

08:49.480 --> 08:53.320
I may rewire that when I replace that, that, that 50 Hertz thing.

08:53.320 --> 08:59.120
But so super green, super green when I wired this, before I had this, I wired super green

08:59.120 --> 09:00.880
in from here and it wasn't called super green.

09:00.880 --> 09:06.360
It was on my 1500 watt 12 volt inverter before the one I had before, but switch to 24 volt

09:06.360 --> 09:07.360
last year.

09:07.360 --> 09:08.360
Right.

09:08.360 --> 09:09.360
I remember that.

09:09.360 --> 09:10.360
Okay.

09:10.360 --> 09:17.960
So, so, uh, but I just moved the existing solar circuit over to, uh, uh, super green

09:17.960 --> 09:23.120
and then now I'm, I'm, I'm making semi green when I added this new 3000 watt inverter.

09:23.120 --> 09:25.280
So this is the only semi green outlet here.

09:25.280 --> 09:28.520
This is a full charger timer and it turns right now, it's on super green.

09:28.520 --> 09:29.520
That charges these.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.920
I'm going to move this to this and make more outlets out here on this.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.880
Wait, you got tool charge on super green?

09:33.880 --> 09:38.560
It was because it was the original, it was the original 12 volt system, which was a 1500

09:38.560 --> 09:39.560
watt.

09:39.560 --> 09:41.680
I still have that inverter in a box somewhere.

09:41.680 --> 09:42.680
Okay.

09:42.680 --> 09:47.240
I have, I have a complete 12 volt setup in boxes and actually, you know, somebody wants

09:47.240 --> 09:54.200
a real small 12 volt setup, everything, but the panels, the, uh, so believe it or not,

09:54.200 --> 09:58.840
uh, uh, then when we organize the garage this summer, we put all these, I used to have these

09:58.840 --> 09:59.840
in the house and everything.

09:59.840 --> 10:00.840
Yeah.

10:00.840 --> 10:04.120
Uh, we put them all on this circuit and believe it or not, charging a bunch of these batteries

10:04.120 --> 10:07.200
plus running the thing is too much for super green.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.200
So yeah.

10:08.200 --> 10:12.920
I'll probably keep one super green outlet out here.

10:12.920 --> 10:17.760
I'll probably swap this to be super green and this to be, uh, semi-green.

10:17.760 --> 10:27.120
And then over here, generator only air compressor, I'll probably keep it on generator only.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.120
Okay.

10:28.120 --> 10:32.080
You know, the, uh, you know, the, I don't know, I'd not have a generator, but the lights

10:32.080 --> 10:35.280
and even the tool outlet over there, I'm going to, I'm going to move this.

10:35.280 --> 10:36.280
Okay.

10:36.280 --> 10:41.440
So that one is the lights and tool outlet over here and that one is currently on generator.

10:41.440 --> 10:45.080
Uh, this is add comes right into the, this is a Jane generator panel.

10:45.080 --> 10:46.080
Okay.

10:46.080 --> 10:49.440
And that guy is the compressor plus generator lights.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.440
All right.

10:50.440 --> 10:55.360
Now let me go back over to where the generator, and by the way, one circuit comes out of here,

10:55.360 --> 11:00.480
uh, uh, and the circuit coming out of here goes up to here to the compressor circuit and

11:00.480 --> 11:05.840
then goes back to the generator so that when the generator is running, so I have it, and

11:05.840 --> 11:12.600
it goes through a 15 amp, uh, uh, 15 amp breaker to code and back to the generator, the generator

11:12.600 --> 11:20.080
takes whatever the generator is running, it adds the ability, uh, to charge its own battery

11:20.080 --> 11:21.080
from AC.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.080
Okay.

11:22.080 --> 11:32.000
And, but so, so the circuit, this circuit here, yeah, comes from the garage.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Okay.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.200
Okay, this is output, this is from 120 volt from the garage on the right.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.200
Okay.

11:38.200 --> 11:40.760
And by the way, that home wire is the two-wire start circuit.

11:40.760 --> 11:41.760
Oh, sick.

11:41.760 --> 11:42.760
Okay.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.320
Cause that's just a 12 volt on the battery.

11:44.320 --> 11:45.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:45.320 --> 11:49.600
Now in here, this is, let's say this thing totally shits the bed.

11:49.600 --> 11:50.600
Yeah.

11:50.600 --> 11:55.800
I get a big sort of heavy duty 240 volt portable generator and I flip this double breaker in

11:55.800 --> 11:59.000
one direction on from backup generator.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Okay.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Generic.

12:01.000 --> 12:08.000
Come over here, emergency gen backup, plug in there using this cord.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Okay.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Okay.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
And a manual start, but, and I put this in long ago when I put the generator.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Yeah, yeah.

12:15.000 --> 12:21.480
Now, more recently, since I do want to have charge, I put an input in here from 1000 watt

12:21.480 --> 12:24.640
or 2000 watt right now, it's a 2000 watt.

12:24.640 --> 12:29.960
And this is input from my semi-green portable.

12:29.960 --> 12:39.680
So these either the big generator or this input, this is an input, okay, from here.

12:39.680 --> 12:40.680
From here.

12:40.680 --> 12:41.680
Okay.

12:41.680 --> 12:42.680
So this is where the, this is where.

12:42.680 --> 12:43.680
I ran this all last night.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.680
Right.

12:44.680 --> 12:45.680
This is super quiet.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.080
It's got a low RPM and burner mode.

12:47.080 --> 12:48.080
Okay.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.080
We can run all night if necessary.

12:49.080 --> 12:53.720
Or if I, if it's a cloudy day and I'm telecommuting, it's not super noisy like this and a lot less

12:53.720 --> 12:54.720
wear and tear on a big machine.

12:54.720 --> 12:55.720
Yeah.

12:55.720 --> 12:56.720
This is 6kW.

12:56.720 --> 13:01.000
And I run it, when it's running super efficient, it's putting out about a half a kW.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.680
But it's enough to run the battery charger.

13:02.680 --> 13:03.680
Gotcha.

13:03.680 --> 13:10.200
And by the way, because of the cloudy, that panel feeds 12 volts through this PWM solar

13:10.200 --> 13:14.000
charge controller that feeds back through here, comes back through that red and black

13:14.000 --> 13:28.160
wire into here to keep that battery charge, okay, because, don't put that switch off in

13:28.160 --> 13:31.160
the garage in the generator, we don't need it on.

13:31.160 --> 13:33.160
Switch on the garage.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.160
Okay.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.160
Let's see if I can remember this.

13:36.160 --> 13:38.600
There's one, wait.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.600
Which one?

13:40.600 --> 13:42.000
Fuck.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Compressor switch.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Oh, right, right, right, right, right.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Oh, enabled disable.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Gotcha.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Okay.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Made a noise.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.480
So there's one, two, three switches in here, plus that dial.

13:53.480 --> 13:54.480
All right.

13:54.480 --> 13:55.480
Fuck.

13:55.480 --> 13:56.480
This is complicated.

13:56.480 --> 13:57.480
This is so complicated.

13:57.480 --> 13:58.480
I know.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.480
Oh, here.

13:59.480 --> 14:00.480
Okay.

14:00.480 --> 14:01.480
Has a computer.

14:01.480 --> 14:02.480
Computer.

14:02.480 --> 14:03.480
This thing sucks, right?

14:03.480 --> 14:04.480
Yeah.

14:04.480 --> 14:12.480
Well, it, it, it runs everything, but it's a parasitic load of about 8 watts.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.480
8 watts.

14:13.480 --> 14:14.480
Off the battery.

14:14.480 --> 14:17.760
If I'm here by myself in the generator and hardly runs, this battery goes down.

14:17.760 --> 14:23.920
So the, but right now this battery is fully charged.

14:23.920 --> 14:25.640
This measures the charge level on that battery.

14:25.640 --> 14:26.640
Okay.

14:26.640 --> 14:30.080
It's a totally separate, and these go straight to that little 100 watt panel on the bottom

14:30.080 --> 14:31.080
of there.

14:31.080 --> 14:36.320
That's solar in and coming from load out.

14:36.320 --> 14:38.320
This goes back.

14:38.320 --> 14:41.600
So this also feeds in, in here.

14:41.600 --> 14:47.240
This, no, this, yeah, this goes into here, a 12 volt, oh, that's the negative.

14:47.240 --> 14:48.240
I'm sorry.

14:48.240 --> 14:49.240
That's the negative here.

14:49.240 --> 14:52.560
So this, oh yeah, the red for this actually goes down to charge this.

14:52.560 --> 14:58.640
So if, if I'm running any generator, this actually will add a more charge.

14:58.640 --> 15:00.160
This is such a slow charger.

15:00.160 --> 15:04.000
This is designed for home standby, meaning you've got utility.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
You've got utility.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.480
You've got utility.

15:06.480 --> 15:09.720
This computer has its own little very low current battery charger to keep the battery

15:09.720 --> 15:10.720
topped off.

15:10.720 --> 15:13.440
The generator is running, the generator is keeping the battery topped off, so the battery

15:13.440 --> 15:14.440
is always topped off.

15:14.440 --> 15:15.440
Yeah.

15:15.440 --> 15:16.440
We don't have fucking utility.

15:16.440 --> 15:17.440
Okay.

15:17.440 --> 15:20.920
So if the generator is off and there's no power, otherwise I think this computer will

15:20.920 --> 15:23.080
kill it over the course of four days.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.080
Been there, done that.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.080
Yeah.

15:25.080 --> 15:26.080
Okay.

15:26.080 --> 15:27.080
And that fucking blows.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.640
And so, so I have this whole separate system with its own battery charge.

15:29.640 --> 15:33.120
So this is a complete, you know, completely separate battery charger right there.

15:33.120 --> 15:37.600
Battery charger, solar charge controller, solar panel, and battery, you know.

15:37.600 --> 15:41.600
And hopefully the idea is that the eight watts from there is outweighed by that hundred

15:41.600 --> 15:42.600
watts there.

15:42.600 --> 15:43.600
Over the course of 24 hours.

15:43.600 --> 15:44.600
Okay.

15:44.600 --> 15:50.360
But if I, you know, but the nice thing is if I run either that or this, this goes off.

15:50.360 --> 15:51.360
Got it.

15:51.360 --> 15:52.360
Okay.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.720
Like, like for example, notice it was on and flashing.

15:54.720 --> 15:55.720
Yeah.

15:55.720 --> 15:56.720
But.

15:56.720 --> 15:57.720
Did I have gas?

15:57.720 --> 15:58.720
Get a little bit.

15:58.720 --> 15:59.720
I'm gonna have to.

15:59.720 --> 16:00.720
Oh, did it run out overnight?

16:00.720 --> 16:01.720
No, it didn't.

16:01.720 --> 16:02.720
All right.

16:02.720 --> 16:18.120
So the relays in there will prep, this will preempt this and either this or this will

16:18.120 --> 16:21.760
preempt the solar charge controller on semi-green.

16:21.760 --> 16:22.760
On semi-green.

16:22.760 --> 16:23.760
Okay.

16:23.760 --> 16:28.880
So yeah, I'm going to top it off tonight because we may have to run it tonight depending

16:28.880 --> 16:29.880
on what we do.

16:29.880 --> 16:33.160
The interesting about it is I can turn, we can let people turn on all the lights inside

16:33.160 --> 16:37.120
the bedrooms off with that band and then plug in all their gadgets onto the semi-green

16:37.120 --> 16:38.120
circuit.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.120
That's what I'm saying.

16:39.120 --> 16:40.120
Charge your phones in your bedrooms.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.120
Yeah.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.120
Okay.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.120
Not in the charge.

16:43.120 --> 16:47.440
Because the charge station is super green, which is purely solar and solar is not happening

16:47.440 --> 16:48.440
right now.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.800
It's not only purely solar battery, but it's only 300 watts.

16:51.800 --> 16:52.800
Right.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.120
Because it would, it's heritage dates to.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.120
Yeah.

16:56.120 --> 16:59.720
All these fucking phones now use like 15 watt chargers and shit and like 30 watt chargers.

16:59.720 --> 17:02.880
Well they quickly dropped down to a much lower current weight.

17:02.880 --> 17:10.720
It's glass tops, dead glass tops, five dead glass tops will blow out the super green.

17:10.720 --> 17:15.600
And so you said that there was a fuse attached to the super green and that's like not a reusable

17:15.600 --> 17:16.600
fuse.

17:16.600 --> 17:17.600
That just like.

17:17.600 --> 17:18.600
Yeah.

17:18.600 --> 17:19.600
It's actually, it's on the inverter itself.

17:19.600 --> 17:20.600
Cool.

17:20.600 --> 17:21.600
Okay.

17:21.600 --> 17:22.600
Yeah.

17:22.600 --> 17:23.600
And I have blown that.

17:23.600 --> 17:27.280
Actually what happens is half the time the thing goes beep and shuts off.

17:27.280 --> 17:33.000
Ah, cause it'll, it'll smart enough to recognize that it's over current and it'll peace out.

17:33.000 --> 17:39.320
But it, you know, the nice thing is, is that super green is enough with my very low current

17:39.320 --> 17:40.880
and that's why I got the Euro.

17:40.880 --> 17:47.120
My brother Jeff installed the Nero and this, the one you helped survey and I was looking

17:47.120 --> 17:48.120
at his power consumption.

17:48.120 --> 17:49.120
I go, fuck.

17:49.120 --> 17:50.120
And that's why I got it.

17:50.120 --> 17:56.200
I mean, I gave up a lot of networking functionality like VLANs and, you know, it does now port

17:56.200 --> 17:57.200
in.

17:57.200 --> 17:58.200
So let me put this on now.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.200
On.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.200
Yeah.

18:00.200 --> 18:14.200
Sometimes when you start these things and then you turn them on for me.

18:14.200 --> 18:25.640
So now, now what is happening is, um, that charger's on.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.520
Right now everything's happy and fully charged.

18:27.520 --> 18:28.520
Yeah.

18:28.520 --> 18:29.520
The sun is happy.

18:29.520 --> 18:30.520
That charger says fully charged.

18:30.520 --> 18:41.520
So, but power is coming from there through here, into here, by the way, that has its

18:41.520 --> 18:42.520
own overload protection.

18:42.520 --> 18:43.520
So it's not directly fused.

18:43.520 --> 18:44.520
Okay.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.520
That generator.

18:45.520 --> 18:46.520
Gotcha.

18:46.520 --> 18:47.520
Okay.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.920
But when it comes through the big generator comes from the 15 amp fuse on.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.000
So semi green is 15 amps.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
So that's like 1800 watts.

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
Okay, it's a single circuit, not really to code, you know, got too many outlets on it

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
with you.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Okay.

19:00.000 --> 19:10.200
So the battery charger's charging, but and, and, uh, semi green inverter is on and, you

19:10.200 --> 19:11.480
know, so everything's in the house.

19:11.480 --> 19:17.080
So semi green inverters not have any load because this green, this, this breaker here,

19:17.080 --> 19:25.720
the preamp should relay, uh, from, uh, Jenset preamp and then over here is semi green Jenset

19:25.720 --> 19:27.220
preamp solar.

19:27.220 --> 19:34.600
So basically if both generators, the big one, the 15 amp circuit that comes back from the

19:34.600 --> 19:41.240
garage from the big generator, the, the circuit from that small plug, yeah, coming to this

19:41.240 --> 19:46.560
relay, if the big generator runs, now if I put your hand on here.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.560
Okay.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.560
What am I supposed to feel?

19:49.560 --> 19:50.560
What?

19:50.560 --> 19:51.560
Listen.

19:51.560 --> 19:52.560
Wait.

19:52.560 --> 19:53.560
Oh, okay.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.560
Okay.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.560
It switched to the big generator.

19:55.560 --> 19:56.560
Yeah.

19:56.560 --> 19:57.560
Okay.

19:57.560 --> 19:58.560
After the generator started.

19:58.560 --> 19:59.560
Okay.

19:59.560 --> 20:00.560
Okay.

20:00.560 --> 20:01.560
Put your hand back on it.

20:01.560 --> 20:02.560
Where's this?

20:02.560 --> 20:03.560
Where's my indicator light?

20:03.560 --> 20:04.560
So.

20:04.560 --> 20:05.560
That's on generator.

20:05.560 --> 20:06.560
Over here.

20:06.560 --> 20:07.560
Okay.

20:07.560 --> 20:17.560
Now it's on the little generator.

20:17.560 --> 20:18.560
Okay.

20:18.560 --> 20:19.560
Okay.

20:19.560 --> 20:20.560
Go turn.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.560
Uh, hang on.

20:21.560 --> 20:22.560
I'm just going to plug it here.

20:22.560 --> 20:23.560
Uh, what?

20:23.560 --> 20:24.560
Take a look.

20:24.560 --> 20:25.560
Okay.

20:25.560 --> 20:26.560
I'm going to plug in the generator.

20:26.560 --> 20:27.560
Oh.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.560
Now it's on the little generator.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.560
Okay.

20:29.560 --> 20:30.560
Okay.

20:30.560 --> 20:31.560
Okay.

20:31.560 --> 20:32.560
Go turn.

20:32.560 --> 20:33.560
Uh, hang on.

20:33.560 --> 20:34.560
I'm just going to plug it here.

20:34.560 --> 20:35.560
Uh.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.560
I'm going to plug in the generator.

20:37.560 --> 20:38.560
Oh.

20:38.560 --> 20:39.560
Now it's on inverter.

20:39.560 --> 20:40.560
Yeah.

20:40.560 --> 20:41.560
Yeah.

20:41.560 --> 20:42.560
Yeah.

20:42.560 --> 20:43.560
50 fucking hertz.

20:43.560 --> 20:44.560
Okay.

20:44.560 --> 20:45.560
Okay.

20:45.560 --> 20:46.560
Uh, uh, isn't that nice?

20:46.560 --> 20:47.560
Yeah.

20:47.560 --> 20:48.560
That's fucking sick.

20:48.560 --> 20:49.560
Okay.

20:49.560 --> 20:50.560
I'm plugging it back in.

20:50.560 --> 20:51.560
Okay.

20:51.560 --> 20:52.560
So what exactly is this device?

20:52.560 --> 20:57.560
So this is a two pole, uh, uh, two pole, uh, uh, relay.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.560
Two pole relay.

20:58.560 --> 20:59.560
Okay.

20:59.560 --> 21:00.560
And this is the same thing.

21:00.560 --> 21:01.560
Okay.

21:01.560 --> 21:02.560
Gotcha.

21:02.560 --> 21:03.560
So literally like what happens is.

21:03.560 --> 21:04.560
What's that big electrical?

21:04.560 --> 21:05.560
That's big.

21:05.560 --> 21:06.560
Granger supply.

21:06.560 --> 21:07.560
Granger supply.

21:07.560 --> 21:08.560
Okay.

21:08.560 --> 21:09.560
Awesome.

21:09.560 --> 21:10.560
Awesome.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.560
Awesome.

21:11.560 --> 21:12.560
Yeah.

21:12.560 --> 21:13.560
For sure.

21:13.560 --> 21:14.560
Okay.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.560
So, so if I understand this correctly, like you've got like the, the, the arm of the relay,

21:15.560 --> 21:16.560
right?

21:16.560 --> 21:17.560
Like hooked up to.

21:17.560 --> 21:18.560
Normally closed in one direction.

21:18.560 --> 21:19.560
Right.

21:19.560 --> 21:20.560
Normally closed in one direction.

21:20.560 --> 21:21.560
And then when, when power is.

21:21.560 --> 21:23.560
Normally closed for everything means it's going to pull from here.

21:23.560 --> 21:24.560
Right.

21:24.560 --> 21:27.560
Power from, from, from, from big generator hits here.

21:27.560 --> 21:28.560
Yeah.

21:28.560 --> 21:31.560
So power from big generator here, here it switches it to big generator.

21:31.560 --> 21:32.560
Yeah.

21:32.560 --> 21:33.560
Okay.

21:33.560 --> 21:34.560
So what power comes into here?

21:34.560 --> 21:35.560
It then goes to here.

21:35.560 --> 21:42.060
If power comes from here, it's the fault node is with no power called to the, to the coil

21:42.060 --> 21:46.360
is from inverter, but when any generator is running, this one flips.

21:46.360 --> 21:49.560
So you feel this one flip in either case, you get a flicker.

21:49.560 --> 21:50.560
Okay.

21:50.560 --> 21:51.560
Okay.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.560
So the, the.

21:52.560 --> 21:58.560
So now I'm just running the big generator for no fucking reason.

21:58.560 --> 22:03.560
Fucking hell.

22:03.560 --> 22:08.560
And I'm going to turn off.

22:08.560 --> 22:13.560
This is a 22 minute long video.

22:13.560 --> 22:16.560
Oh, I heard a, I heard a click.

22:16.560 --> 22:21.560
So now the, now this boy's off back on this guy and this guy pulls from batteries.

22:21.560 --> 22:22.560
Yeah.

22:22.560 --> 22:26.560
That pulls from the batteries, which is of course charged by that big fuck off thing over

22:26.560 --> 22:27.560
there.

22:27.560 --> 22:31.560
So if the summer, believe it or not, I can, you know, if I have a well good summer, summer

22:31.560 --> 22:36.560
day, I just leave some green on and the generators only runs on the pump and I don't need the

22:36.560 --> 22:37.560
portable.

22:37.560 --> 22:38.560
Okay.

22:38.560 --> 22:41.560
You know, and if I actually added a little bit more batteries would be better, but I've

22:41.560 --> 22:42.560
got 800 amp hours.

22:42.560 --> 22:44.240
I'll get you there in a second.

22:44.240 --> 22:46.560
So that's basically this circuitry here.

22:46.560 --> 22:47.560
Okay.

22:47.560 --> 22:51.560
Let's go and take a look at the basement.

22:51.560 --> 22:52.560
Sweet.

22:52.560 --> 22:53.560
Parasig load.

22:53.560 --> 22:54.560
Yeah.

22:54.560 --> 23:00.560
From a distance, you can tell the generator's running, but I chase every person.

23:00.560 --> 23:01.560
Oh, for sure.

23:01.560 --> 23:02.560
100%.

23:02.560 --> 23:03.560
100%.

23:03.560 --> 23:04.560
One more quick question.

23:04.560 --> 23:05.560
What?

23:05.560 --> 23:09.560
So this 15 watt panel right here, that, that charges a battery in here.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.560
One of those, just one of those little batteries.

23:11.560 --> 23:12.560
I had two of them here.

23:12.560 --> 23:14.560
My old hundred watt system had two of these big batteries.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.560
The other one was totally shot.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.560
I turned it in.

23:16.560 --> 23:17.560
It just maintains.

23:17.560 --> 23:21.560
So, you know, if, if a lead acid battery goes too dead, it can freeze and damage.

23:21.560 --> 23:22.560
It's like fucked.

23:22.560 --> 23:23.560
Okay.

23:23.560 --> 23:26.560
And apparently it gets a long time for a big battery like that to go bad.

23:26.560 --> 23:28.560
It would last a couple of years, but yeah.

23:28.560 --> 23:31.560
I heard you said 20 years at some point.

23:31.560 --> 23:32.560
Well it freezing weather.

23:32.560 --> 23:33.560
You know, not good.

23:33.560 --> 23:37.800
That's why like when your car goes dead, the winter and you leave your battery dead and

23:37.800 --> 23:43.560
you let it freeze, because all the sulfur is on the plate and that water in the battery.

23:43.560 --> 23:44.560
Yeah.

23:44.560 --> 23:45.560
Especially a flooded battery.

23:45.560 --> 23:46.560
So you got to fucking buy a new battery.

23:46.560 --> 23:47.560
Yeah.

23:47.560 --> 23:48.560
Refurbish the battery.

23:48.560 --> 23:49.560
Yeah.

23:49.560 --> 23:54.560
I think there's one behind the wood.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.560
Have you recorded what this does?

23:56.560 --> 23:57.560
Turn it on for Wi-Fi.

23:57.560 --> 23:58.560
Yeah.

23:58.560 --> 23:59.560
That was towards the beginning.

23:59.560 --> 24:00.560
Okay.

24:00.560 --> 24:01.560
I got something.

24:01.560 --> 24:02.560
But yeah.

24:02.560 --> 24:03.560
Okay.

24:03.560 --> 24:04.560
Okay.

24:04.560 --> 24:05.560
Right.

24:05.560 --> 24:06.560
Yeah.

24:06.560 --> 24:07.560
Yeah.

24:07.560 --> 24:08.560
Yeah.

24:08.560 --> 24:09.560
I remember that.

24:09.560 --> 24:10.560
It's like a simple idiot.

24:10.560 --> 24:11.560
Yeah.

24:11.560 --> 24:12.560
Thanks.

24:12.560 --> 24:13.560
Okay.

24:13.560 --> 24:14.560
Okay.

24:14.560 --> 24:15.560
Okay.

24:15.560 --> 24:16.560
Okay.

24:16.560 --> 24:17.560
Okay.

24:17.560 --> 24:19.560
Yeah.

24:19.560 --> 24:20.560
Okay.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.560
Okay.

24:21.560 --> 24:22.560
Yeah.

24:22.560 --> 24:23.560
Okay.

24:23.560 --> 24:24.560
Yeah.

24:24.560 --> 24:25.560
Yeah.

24:25.560 --> 24:26.560
That's what we're done here.

24:26.560 --> 24:27.560
I gotta send it.

24:27.560 --> 24:28.560
I hope it's fine.

24:28.560 --> 24:29.560
Don't break a leg.

24:29.560 --> 24:30.560
Again.

24:30.560 --> 24:31.560
Bozo.

24:31.560 --> 24:32.560
That bozo broken ankle.

24:32.560 --> 24:33.560
So in here, this was last summer.

24:33.560 --> 24:34.560
Last summer?

24:34.560 --> 24:35.560
A year ago.

24:35.560 --> 24:36.560
Oh shit.

24:36.560 --> 24:37.560
Son.

24:37.560 --> 24:38.560
We got stacks on stacks.

24:38.560 --> 24:39.560
Yeah.

24:39.560 --> 24:40.560
So this assembles.

24:40.560 --> 24:41.560
Okay.

24:41.560 --> 24:42.560
This is gravity fed.

24:42.560 --> 24:47.560
I built this with a river a year ago this summer.

24:47.560 --> 24:51.560
And at the same time, Connor and I put those 400 watt panels over the garage.

24:51.560 --> 24:52.560
Right.

24:52.560 --> 24:55.560
And that had, I had the, I only had to buy one more.

24:55.560 --> 24:58.560
I had three left over from my old original 12 volt setup.

24:58.560 --> 24:59.560
Yeah.

24:59.560 --> 25:04.560
And then this is also a preemptive, this actually actually preemptive circuitry built in.

25:04.560 --> 25:06.560
I bought this to replace that fridge.

25:06.560 --> 25:07.560
Right.

25:07.560 --> 25:12.560
Whatever any generator runs.

25:12.560 --> 25:13.560
Okay.

25:13.560 --> 25:14.560
This comes off.

25:14.560 --> 25:15.560
So this comes off.

25:15.560 --> 25:17.560
This turns on the fridge.

25:17.560 --> 25:18.560
Okay.

25:18.560 --> 25:19.560
That's the fridge.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.560
This is actually a two pole switch.

25:21.560 --> 25:22.560
Yeah.

25:22.560 --> 25:25.560
So it'll switch both the 24 volts straight from the batteries.

25:25.560 --> 25:27.560
And this comes from one of the fuses in there.

25:27.560 --> 25:28.560
24 volts.

25:28.560 --> 25:32.560
And, and so a cigarette ladder, but it's 24 volts.

25:32.560 --> 25:33.560
Wait.

25:33.560 --> 25:35.560
So this is a truckers fridge.

25:35.560 --> 25:37.560
You put this in a semi-track.

25:37.560 --> 25:38.560
Most trucks are truckers.

25:38.560 --> 25:39.560
They semi-track.

25:39.560 --> 25:42.560
He has this for his cold stuff in the, in the back of his, your super cap.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.560
Arguably the most important switch in the camp is that one.

25:44.560 --> 25:45.560
Cause that's the beer fridge.

25:45.560 --> 25:46.560
You got it.

25:46.560 --> 25:47.560
Especially in the summer.

25:47.560 --> 25:48.560
So yeah.

25:48.560 --> 25:49.560
Okay.

25:49.560 --> 25:52.560
And actually, actually it's actually great because I can turn the temperature down

25:52.560 --> 25:53.560
to freeze.

25:53.560 --> 25:55.560
And, and it'll be a freezer.

25:55.560 --> 25:56.560
Nice.

25:56.560 --> 25:57.560
And it's highly efficient.

25:57.560 --> 25:58.560
Yeah.

25:58.560 --> 25:59.560
And then the summer, the solar runs it.

25:59.560 --> 26:00.560
Okay.

26:00.560 --> 26:01.560
Awesome.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.560
Okay.

26:02.560 --> 26:03.560
And then whenever the generator runs it preempts to the generator.

26:03.560 --> 26:05.560
And it had that, it had the preempts in certain cases.

26:05.560 --> 26:06.560
Okay.

26:06.560 --> 26:07.560
Just because.

26:07.560 --> 26:08.560
Okay.

26:08.560 --> 26:09.560
Okay.

26:09.560 --> 26:10.560
Okay.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.560
So in other words, obviously, you know, the, the, the, you know, the trucker doesn't

26:12.560 --> 26:15.560
want his truck batteries to go dead and he can't start the fucking truck.

26:15.560 --> 26:20.560
So, you know, the, uh, so, uh, yeah, you know, the, not cheap, but $700.

26:20.560 --> 26:22.560
But, uh, yeah.

26:22.560 --> 26:23.560
Oh.

26:23.560 --> 26:24.560
Yeah.

26:24.560 --> 26:25.560
This was a major improvement here.

26:25.560 --> 26:26.560
So.

26:26.560 --> 26:27.560
Nice.

26:27.560 --> 26:28.560
Very cool.

26:28.560 --> 26:30.560
Um, so these batteries kind of pool with the batteries outside.

26:30.560 --> 26:32.560
No, those batteries outside aren't even used anymore.

26:32.560 --> 26:33.560
Okay.

26:33.560 --> 26:34.560
So those batteries.

26:34.560 --> 26:35.560
They're locked over from a 12 volt system.

26:35.560 --> 26:36.560
Gotcha.

26:36.560 --> 26:37.560
All right.

26:37.560 --> 26:38.560
These are the batteries.

26:38.560 --> 26:40.560
I just, I just want that other, other big one is still pretty good.

26:40.560 --> 26:41.560
Okay.

26:41.560 --> 26:42.560
What do you use?

26:42.560 --> 26:43.560
Is it when you're not using that for anything?

26:43.560 --> 26:45.560
I'm not using it for anything, but it could be part of that 12 volt system I give to

26:45.560 --> 26:46.560
somebody.

26:46.560 --> 26:47.560
Okay.

26:47.560 --> 26:48.560
Okay.

26:48.560 --> 26:49.560
I don't know the parts for the 12 volt system in here.

26:49.560 --> 26:50.560
Ah, this is the, this is the previous gen.

26:50.560 --> 26:52.560
This is what gen, gen two.

26:52.560 --> 26:53.560
Gen one.

26:53.560 --> 26:54.560
Gen one.

26:54.560 --> 26:55.560
What, what gen are we on right now?

26:55.560 --> 26:56.560
So.

26:56.560 --> 26:57.560
Are we on gen two?

26:57.560 --> 26:58.560
We're probably two and a half.

26:58.560 --> 26:59.560
Gen two and a half.

26:59.560 --> 27:00.560
Okay.

27:00.560 --> 27:03.560
So here's my 1000 watt inverter right here.

27:03.560 --> 27:04.560
Okay.

27:04.560 --> 27:05.560
That's the 1000 watt inverter.

27:05.560 --> 27:06.560
Yeah.

27:06.560 --> 27:07.560
12 volts.

27:07.560 --> 27:08.560
12 volt.

27:08.560 --> 27:09.560
1000 watt inverter.

27:09.560 --> 27:10.560
Not interchangeable.

27:10.560 --> 27:12.560
And I have a solar, what I have.

27:12.560 --> 27:16.560
Actually, I have a 100, 100 watt small inverter.

27:16.560 --> 27:18.560
Oh, this is the 20 per volt one.

27:18.560 --> 27:21.560
I have an extra 20 per one in case that super green one fails.

27:21.560 --> 27:22.560
Right.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.560
And I have a 12 volt one as well.

27:23.560 --> 27:24.560
So yeah.

27:24.560 --> 27:25.560
Cool.

27:25.560 --> 27:26.560
So I have, this is enough.

27:26.560 --> 27:30.560
I have enough to make other than the solar panels to make a complete 12 volt system.

27:30.560 --> 27:31.560
Yeah.

27:31.560 --> 27:37.560
That somebody, somebody who's just here in the summer and has like a very lightweight

27:37.560 --> 27:39.560
internet service like, like my arrow.

27:39.560 --> 27:40.560
Yeah.

27:40.560 --> 27:41.560
You know, and they're not here in the winter.

27:41.560 --> 27:45.560
That could be more than enough for, you know, probably I would just run with four panels

27:45.560 --> 27:49.560
and that inverter, one or two of those bat batteries.

27:49.560 --> 27:50.560
Sure.

27:50.560 --> 27:51.560
And they'd be good to go.

27:51.560 --> 27:52.560
Nice.

27:52.560 --> 27:55.560
And so remind me, why did you switch to 24 volt?

27:55.560 --> 27:56.560
Fatness of wires.

27:56.560 --> 27:57.560
Fatness of wires.

27:57.560 --> 27:58.560
Okay.

27:58.560 --> 27:59.560
The what, the 12 volt wire is coming.

27:59.560 --> 28:00.560
Oh, they're coming from behind.

28:00.560 --> 28:01.560
This is this.

28:01.560 --> 28:04.560
And even these are slightly underrated, but I don't, I don't, since I'm not running,

28:04.560 --> 28:06.560
you know, I don't draw 3,000 watts.

28:06.560 --> 28:07.560
Yeah.

28:07.560 --> 28:08.560
Okay.

28:08.560 --> 28:09.560
And it can take a surge.

28:09.560 --> 28:14.560
But technically this should be, this is, I think four out gauge.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.560
I think it should be, I think four out gauge.

28:17.560 --> 28:26.560
I think it should be two or one odd four, which is like, and, and if I were 12 volt,

28:26.560 --> 28:30.560
it would have to be just fucking and just managing and dealing with it.

28:30.560 --> 28:33.560
They're, they're distance lengths and there's calculations, what you have to have.

28:33.560 --> 28:34.560
Yeah.

28:34.560 --> 28:40.560
And, and, and ideally, you know, I can get double the power if I just switched to 48

28:40.560 --> 28:42.560
volt and I wouldn't even need to change these wires.

28:42.560 --> 28:43.560
Okay.

28:43.560 --> 28:48.560
And I just rewire these.

28:48.560 --> 28:53.560
So these are 12 volt batteries, two banks, each in parallel.

28:53.560 --> 28:58.560
And also, I'll show you how I will draw it on paper because I can show you.

28:58.560 --> 28:59.560
Yes, please.

28:59.560 --> 29:00.560
Okay.

29:00.560 --> 29:01.560
Yeah.

29:01.560 --> 29:03.560
I've got a, I got a sketchbook.

29:03.560 --> 29:05.560
We can, we can do it in there.

29:05.560 --> 29:07.560
It's like actually proper.

29:07.560 --> 29:09.560
You're filming that you're going to be watching this.

29:09.560 --> 29:12.560
This is a 29 minute long video Potter.

29:12.560 --> 29:13.560
Oh, yeah.

29:13.560 --> 29:14.560
Oh, yeah.

29:14.560 --> 29:16.560
Oh, I'll show you the base.

29:16.560 --> 29:17.560
Okay.

29:17.560 --> 29:22.560
That's just, just a selection of distribution and it needs a lot.

29:22.560 --> 29:25.560
I did some rework this summer.

29:25.560 --> 29:26.560
Okay.

29:26.560 --> 29:31.560
Like all the new wiring we put in to, to, to house helped and a whole bunch of CSU just

29:31.560 --> 29:33.560
helped me wire crawling under the camp.

29:33.560 --> 29:36.560
Also, you know, during the middle of the season.

29:36.560 --> 29:37.560
Fuck.

29:37.560 --> 29:38.560
Was that bad?

29:38.560 --> 29:39.560
That was bad.

29:39.560 --> 29:40.560
Wasn't it?

29:40.560 --> 29:41.560
It was pretty rough.

29:41.560 --> 29:42.560
It was still fun.

29:42.560 --> 29:43.560
All right.

29:43.560 --> 29:44.560
Yeah.

29:44.560 --> 29:45.560
Okay.

29:45.560 --> 29:51.560
I have a light on super green that turns on some, you know, LED lights there.

29:51.560 --> 29:52.560
Yeah.

29:52.560 --> 29:54.560
So this is basement light on a timer, always.

29:54.560 --> 29:55.560
Timers for everything.

29:55.560 --> 29:56.560
More fucking time.

29:56.560 --> 29:59.560
This is the main sub panel from the generator.

29:59.560 --> 30:00.560
Okay.

30:00.560 --> 30:01.560
Okay.

30:01.560 --> 30:02.560
Okay.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.560
And I've got a bunch of newsbreakers here that I put them in.

30:04.560 --> 30:07.560
I think I was going to wire the whole house from the main generator.

30:07.560 --> 30:09.560
I'll probably never use all these circuits, but there they are.

30:09.560 --> 30:10.560
There you have them.

30:10.560 --> 30:11.560
Okay.

30:11.560 --> 30:15.560
This is a 240 volt circuit going to the water pump system.

30:15.560 --> 30:16.560
This boy?

30:16.560 --> 30:17.560
Yeah.

30:17.560 --> 30:18.560
Okay.

30:18.560 --> 30:20.560
So interesting for the water pump system it had to do with the generator.

30:20.560 --> 30:25.560
This is a two pole start switch for switch the, so switch the 240 volts with phase.

30:25.560 --> 30:26.560
Yeah.

30:26.560 --> 30:29.560
Normally at a well, you would run 240 volt in and out and it would click on and off the

30:29.560 --> 30:31.560
pump as needed at a house.

30:31.560 --> 30:32.560
Okay.

30:32.560 --> 30:33.560
With utility.

30:33.560 --> 30:36.560
The problem is I need to use one of the poles of this.

30:36.560 --> 30:37.560
Yeah.

30:37.560 --> 30:38.560
It's just a two pole switch.

30:38.560 --> 30:39.560
Okay.

30:39.560 --> 30:42.560
And if I push on this right here.

30:42.560 --> 30:45.560
What are you pushing on?

30:45.560 --> 30:46.560
Click.

30:46.560 --> 30:47.560
Click.

30:47.560 --> 30:48.560
I just went out of water.

30:48.560 --> 30:49.560
Now.

30:49.560 --> 30:51.560
Timer goes.

30:51.560 --> 30:55.560
It's pumping.

30:55.560 --> 30:57.560
I just forced it to pump.

30:57.560 --> 30:58.560
Yeah.

30:58.560 --> 31:01.560
It's almost full so it's going to start off any minute, but that turned on that.

31:01.560 --> 31:02.560
That plugged into Gen-O-Me.

31:02.560 --> 31:04.560
Notice I labeled that Gen-O-Me?

31:04.560 --> 31:05.560
Gen-O-Me.

31:05.560 --> 31:06.560
Okay.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.560
And I noticed I labeled that one up there super green.

31:08.560 --> 31:09.560
Super green.

31:09.560 --> 31:15.560
And I didn't, that's a new little distribution box up there that moved some of the wires

31:15.560 --> 31:20.560
from Gen to semi-green and super green.

31:20.560 --> 31:22.560
So I have a split super green.

31:22.560 --> 31:26.560
The upstairs outlet in the loft and in my bedroom is that four wire.

31:26.560 --> 31:27.560
Okay.

31:27.560 --> 31:30.560
So it takes both super green and semi-green upstairs.

31:30.560 --> 31:34.560
The, well, it's full.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.560
There you go.

31:36.560 --> 31:44.560
So all of this, and by the way, so what it's this is, this is, so obviously I need a 12

31:44.560 --> 31:45.560
volt circuit.

31:45.560 --> 31:48.560
The 12 volt start circuit for the generator has to come through all this.

31:48.560 --> 31:50.560
It comes all the way down to this switch.

31:50.560 --> 31:51.560
Comes into here.

31:51.560 --> 31:55.560
This switch disables it so the water can't start the generator.

31:55.560 --> 31:56.560
Disable.

31:56.560 --> 31:57.560
Disable.

31:57.560 --> 32:01.560
And then if the generator is running, it would actually still get power.

32:01.560 --> 32:02.560
Actually, no, it won't.

32:02.560 --> 32:03.560
It won't get power.

32:03.560 --> 32:07.560
But if you totally want it, you can turn off, this is a 240 volt breaker to the pump.

32:07.560 --> 32:09.560
But normal operation, this is on.

32:09.560 --> 32:12.560
This has been there since I put the generator in back in 2011.

32:12.560 --> 32:13.560
Okay.

32:13.560 --> 32:14.560
Okay.

32:14.560 --> 32:16.560
And again, this is the start circuit.

32:16.560 --> 32:19.560
This was the CAT 3 cable I stole from RIT.

32:19.560 --> 32:21.560
Oh my fucking god.

32:21.560 --> 32:23.560
Incredible.

32:23.560 --> 32:28.560
But yeah, there's that.

32:28.560 --> 32:33.560
And then I've been building out this new sub panel and he's on semi green.

32:33.560 --> 32:34.560
Okay.

32:34.560 --> 32:36.560
So he comes straight from the semi green.

32:36.560 --> 32:39.560
And I use these extra, this actually was water pump wire.

32:39.560 --> 32:43.560
So when I built the thing, I actually put a lot of extra wire in the conduit from the

32:43.560 --> 32:44.560
garage to the house.

32:44.560 --> 32:46.560
I have not had to put any new wires in.

32:46.560 --> 32:48.560
So I have circuits.

32:48.560 --> 32:54.560
I have cables for three separate sources of 120 volt power from the day I put the generator

32:54.560 --> 32:55.560
in the garage.

32:55.560 --> 32:56.560
Very nice.

32:56.560 --> 32:57.560
Okay.

32:57.560 --> 32:58.560
And it sat there unused.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.560
And it's been very nice.

33:00.560 --> 33:02.560
But right now I have.

33:02.560 --> 33:06.560
So, so these are the new circuits we put in this summer that Klaus and the boys have

33:06.560 --> 33:07.560
saved to help me with.

33:07.560 --> 33:08.560
Danny and Lonnie.

33:08.560 --> 33:09.560
Yeah.

33:09.560 --> 33:10.560
Danny and Lonnie.

33:10.560 --> 33:11.560
What did that say?

33:11.560 --> 33:12.560
What did that say over there?

33:12.560 --> 33:18.560
Basement, bathroom, kitchen, kitchen net.

33:18.560 --> 33:23.560
But that actually is not hooked up yet.

33:23.560 --> 33:24.560
Okay.

33:24.560 --> 33:25.560
It will be.

33:25.560 --> 33:26.560
I'm going to move the semi green kitchen.

33:26.560 --> 33:27.560
Switch on the floor there.

33:27.560 --> 33:30.560
That switch on the floor is coming off of super green only right now.

33:30.560 --> 33:31.560
Okay.

33:31.560 --> 33:32.560
I got to move that.

33:32.560 --> 33:33.560
I moved that switch on the floor.

33:33.560 --> 33:34.560
Actually, I'm actually going to rewire.

33:34.560 --> 33:36.560
I'm going to wire up to those up above lights.

33:36.560 --> 33:39.560
I like the indirect lights shining on the ceiling.

33:39.560 --> 33:40.560
Yeah.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.560
Okay.

33:41.560 --> 33:42.560
Okay.

33:42.560 --> 33:43.560
The makes a nice warm light in there.

33:43.560 --> 33:45.560
I have to do more of those.

33:45.560 --> 33:51.560
And so I'm going to just run super green to the desk with the internet and everything

33:51.560 --> 33:55.560
else will be on semi green, especially once I get the right inverter going.

33:55.560 --> 34:03.560
And then, but so the bathroom, I figured I was going to have a separate circuit.

34:03.560 --> 34:06.560
What does this say?

34:06.560 --> 34:07.560
15 amp.

34:07.560 --> 34:09.560
I can't even read my writing there.

34:09.560 --> 34:10.560
I'm terrible.

34:10.560 --> 34:11.560
I'm already terrible.

34:11.560 --> 34:12.560
You've got to get the label maker down here.

34:12.560 --> 34:13.560
I know.

34:13.560 --> 34:14.560
Yeah.

34:14.560 --> 34:15.560
It doesn't stick.

34:15.560 --> 34:16.560
You need a better label maker.

34:16.560 --> 34:17.560
That label maker, they fall off.

34:17.560 --> 34:18.560
Yeah.

34:18.560 --> 34:19.560
They just suck.

34:19.560 --> 34:20.560
Get the class label maker.

34:20.560 --> 34:21.560
I don't know.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.560
I used cheaply.

34:22.560 --> 34:23.560
Fozo.

34:23.560 --> 34:28.560
But yeah, this is just a basic soap panel.

34:28.560 --> 34:33.560
And what happens is I bring three wires in, but I just bring the two hots together because

34:33.560 --> 34:37.560
it's, this is actually, I'm only getting 15 amps.

34:37.560 --> 34:40.560
Now let's, oh, one last thing I didn't show you.

34:40.560 --> 34:41.560
Okay.

34:41.560 --> 34:42.560
Over here.

34:42.560 --> 34:53.560
But it's nice when I arrived in the summer and I disabled my water when I leave in the

34:53.560 --> 34:55.560
summer just so that it doesn't actually start in pulp.

34:55.560 --> 34:57.560
And I disabled my generator.

34:57.560 --> 34:58.560
Yeah.

34:58.560 --> 35:01.560
By the way, I didn't show you my disabled process.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.560
I might as well show you that.

35:03.560 --> 35:04.560
Sure.

35:04.560 --> 35:10.560
So because we're in the garage, the most annoying thing about that computer generator, you're

35:10.560 --> 35:20.560
gonna, you know, I already, Steve Green helped me fix the computer generator one time because

35:20.560 --> 35:25.560
I had to put in Potter designed lightning protection.

35:25.560 --> 35:27.560
Potter designed lightning protection.

35:27.560 --> 35:28.560
Because the computer generator.

35:28.560 --> 35:29.560
It's intense.

35:29.560 --> 35:33.560
Computer was dried by a nearby lightning storm shortly after.

35:33.560 --> 35:34.560
Oh, when was that?

35:34.560 --> 35:36.560
Oh, it's a bunch of years ago.

35:36.560 --> 35:37.560
Okay.

35:37.560 --> 35:42.560
And it was after the warranty of the generator expired and $400 for a new fucking computer.

35:42.560 --> 35:43.560
That blows chunks.

35:43.560 --> 35:50.560
So here, when I leave camp, the Tarte circuit from house and everywhere comes through this

35:50.560 --> 35:51.560
box that I designed.

35:51.560 --> 35:52.560
What's in there?

35:52.560 --> 35:55.560
It's a surge suppression circuit.

35:55.560 --> 35:57.560
Switch on top.

35:57.560 --> 35:58.560
Yeah.

35:58.560 --> 36:03.560
That basically takes all the wire and shunts them to ground.

36:03.560 --> 36:06.560
So here's an honor start for the generator.

36:06.560 --> 36:07.560
I flipped this.

36:07.560 --> 36:08.560
Nothing happened.

36:08.560 --> 36:09.560
Okay.

36:09.560 --> 36:13.560
The computer is still ready to run, but there's any lightning strikes that strikes the ground

36:13.560 --> 36:18.560
and induces through the start circuit is not going to come through to the generator computer.

36:18.560 --> 36:19.560
Okay.

36:19.560 --> 36:20.560
Get pranked.

36:20.560 --> 36:21.560
Okay.

36:21.560 --> 36:22.560
So ready to run.

36:22.560 --> 36:23.560
So this doesn't know it's not a source.

36:23.560 --> 36:24.560
So I got no way to start.

36:24.560 --> 36:27.560
I can go over here and push it to manual start, but it's on auto start.

36:27.560 --> 36:28.560
Okay.

36:28.560 --> 36:32.560
This putting it to the center position means I can turn this back on.

36:32.560 --> 36:33.560
No startage.

36:33.560 --> 36:34.560
It's on here.

36:34.560 --> 36:37.560
Basically, all these start triggers are just hooked in parallel.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.560
Sometimes where did I turn the generator?

36:39.560 --> 36:40.560
Is the pump pumping?

36:40.560 --> 36:42.560
Is it turned on in the kitchen?

36:42.560 --> 36:44.560
Is it turned on in the garage?

36:44.560 --> 36:46.560
Or is it turned on out here?

36:46.560 --> 36:50.560
You've got to get like a status LED or some shit to like let you know.

36:50.560 --> 36:51.560
Well, I do.

36:51.560 --> 36:52.560
There's lights in various places.

36:52.560 --> 36:55.560
We need like a whole switchboard, like a centralized switchboard somewhere.

36:55.560 --> 36:59.560
But this is a surge suppression circuit and it has a solid state relay.

36:59.560 --> 37:05.560
When I came up here, Steve Green, I had a solid state relay and it fried.

37:05.560 --> 37:07.560
Which was not a bad thing.

37:07.560 --> 37:08.560
It saved the generator.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.560
Steve Green helped me wire this.

37:10.560 --> 37:16.560
But so here's what happens is we'll go through my arrival routine.

37:16.560 --> 37:18.560
So this is always slipped off when I leave camp.

37:18.560 --> 37:19.560
Okay.

37:19.560 --> 37:20.560
Just to ground everything.

37:20.560 --> 37:21.560
Right.

37:21.560 --> 37:24.560
But if the lightning strikes when I'm in camp, that circuitry probably protects me anyway.

37:24.560 --> 37:25.560
Okay.

37:25.560 --> 37:26.560
Yeah.

37:26.560 --> 37:29.560
That surge suppression circuitry I bought.

37:29.560 --> 37:31.560
So this off.

37:31.560 --> 37:36.560
Now, this means the solar charge controller is still topping out the battery.

37:36.560 --> 37:39.560
So no self-discharge.

37:39.560 --> 37:42.560
And nothing will start to generator.

37:42.560 --> 37:43.560
Okay.

37:43.560 --> 37:44.560
I arrive.

37:44.560 --> 37:45.560
This is on.

37:45.560 --> 37:46.560
First thing I come out here.

37:46.560 --> 37:47.560
You always see me come out here.

37:47.560 --> 37:48.560
Yeah, right.

37:48.560 --> 37:49.560
Okay.

37:49.560 --> 37:50.560
I come out here.

37:50.560 --> 37:51.560
Put it up.

37:51.560 --> 37:52.560
Put this on.

37:52.560 --> 37:53.560
On.

37:53.560 --> 37:58.560
I had to, there's a fuse here for the computer.

37:58.560 --> 37:59.560
Oh.

37:59.560 --> 38:00.560
Okay.

38:00.560 --> 38:01.560
Sure.

38:01.560 --> 38:03.560
I used to take out the fuse every time I left.

38:03.560 --> 38:04.560
I got pissed at that.

38:04.560 --> 38:05.560
So I wired the switch.

38:05.560 --> 38:06.560
You got a little switch boy.

38:06.560 --> 38:07.560
There's a fuse.

38:07.560 --> 38:08.560
Okay.

38:08.560 --> 38:09.560
It's a fuse.

38:09.560 --> 38:12.560
It's just, it's just like a 5 amp or 10 amp 12 volt fuse.

38:12.560 --> 38:13.560
Okay.

38:13.560 --> 38:14.560
Okay.

38:14.560 --> 38:15.560
So turn this puppy on.

38:15.560 --> 38:17.560
Now look at the computer screen.

38:17.560 --> 38:21.560
Generator active install wizard.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.560
It's not ready to run.

38:23.560 --> 38:24.560
Okay.

38:24.560 --> 38:25.560
Oh my God.

38:25.560 --> 38:26.560
I didn't set the time right.

38:26.560 --> 38:27.560
What time is it?

38:27.560 --> 38:28.560
The time is currently in New York.

38:28.560 --> 38:29.560
It actually has stores and flash memory.

38:29.560 --> 38:30.560
It's run log.

38:30.560 --> 38:31.560
11.53.

38:31.560 --> 38:32.560
Okay.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.560
Enter.

38:33.560 --> 38:34.560
Good enough.

38:34.560 --> 38:35.560
Month.

38:35.560 --> 38:36.560
Deal 12.

38:36.560 --> 38:37.560
Today's the 27th.

38:37.560 --> 38:38.560
I did set that.

38:38.560 --> 38:39.560
Okay.

38:39.560 --> 38:40.560
Now I hit enter.

38:40.560 --> 38:41.560
Today's the 28th.

38:41.560 --> 38:42.560
28th.

38:42.560 --> 38:43.560
Oh well.

38:43.560 --> 38:44.560
Oh well.

38:44.560 --> 38:45.560
Fuck it.

38:45.560 --> 38:46.560
And there.

38:46.560 --> 38:47.560
Okay.

38:47.560 --> 38:48.560
Now it's ready to run.

38:48.560 --> 38:49.560
Why the fuck does your generator need a clock?

38:49.560 --> 38:51.560
Fuck it.

38:51.560 --> 38:52.560
And so I got to go through this.

38:52.560 --> 38:54.560
Now here's what's really bad.

38:54.560 --> 38:55.560
Okay.

38:55.560 --> 38:56.560
You're right here.

38:56.560 --> 38:57.560
It's 15 below.

38:57.560 --> 38:58.560
Oh shit.

38:58.560 --> 38:59.560
This LCD.

38:59.560 --> 39:07.560
It takes like five minutes for the digits to show.

39:07.560 --> 39:09.560
With your fingers fucking freezing.

39:09.560 --> 39:13.560
And I want a fucking digger shot.

39:13.560 --> 39:15.560
I got a fucking deal.

39:15.560 --> 39:16.560
But there it is.

39:16.560 --> 39:17.560
And now we're ready to run.

39:17.560 --> 39:19.560
And it will start.

39:19.560 --> 39:21.560
Why didn't it start?

39:21.560 --> 39:22.560
Enter.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.560
Why is that not a run?

39:24.560 --> 39:25.560
Oh did you switch?

39:25.560 --> 39:26.560
Oh I did.

39:26.560 --> 39:27.560
I know.

39:27.560 --> 39:28.560
Oh yeah.

39:28.560 --> 39:29.560
I did put it in.

39:29.560 --> 39:30.560
Thank you.

39:30.560 --> 39:31.560
So that's that.

39:31.560 --> 39:46.560
And then I apparently changed the oil and oil filter and service and motor.

39:46.560 --> 39:47.560
Okay.

39:47.560 --> 39:48.560
Damn sheesh.

39:48.560 --> 39:49.560
Okay.

39:49.560 --> 39:50.560
So now you've seen the basement.

39:50.560 --> 39:51.560
Did I close up the basement door?

39:51.560 --> 39:52.560
You like shut it.

39:52.560 --> 39:53.560
I don't know if there's like a latch or anything.

39:53.560 --> 39:54.560
No, no, no.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.560
Did I close it?

39:55.560 --> 39:56.560
No.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.560
No.

39:57.560 --> 39:58.560
No.

39:58.560 --> 39:59.560
No.

39:59.560 --> 40:00.560
No.

40:00.560 --> 40:01.560
No.

40:01.560 --> 40:02.560
No.

40:02.560 --> 40:03.560
No.

40:03.560 --> 40:04.560
No.

40:04.560 --> 40:05.560
No.

40:05.560 --> 40:06.560
No.

40:06.560 --> 40:07.560
No.

40:07.560 --> 40:08.560
No.

40:08.560 --> 40:09.560
No.

40:09.560 --> 40:10.560
No.

40:10.560 --> 40:11.560
No.

40:11.560 --> 40:12.560
No.

40:12.560 --> 40:13.560
No.

40:13.560 --> 40:14.560
No.

40:14.560 --> 40:15.560
No.

40:15.560 --> 40:16.560
Yes.

40:16.560 --> 40:17.560
Yes.

40:17.560 --> 40:18.560
No.

40:18.560 --> 40:19.560
No oh.

40:19.560 --> 40:20.560
Oh.

40:20.560 --> 40:21.560
Celine.

40:21.560 --> 40:22.560
No.

40:22.560 --> 40:23.560
No.

40:23.560 --> 40:24.560
No.

40:24.560 --> 40:25.560
No.

40:25.560 --> 40:26.560
No.

40:26.560 --> 40:27.560
No.

40:27.560 --> 40:28.560
No.

40:28.560 --> 40:29.560
No.

40:29.560 --> 40:30.560
No.

40:30.560 --> 40:31.560
No.

40:31.560 --> 40:32.560
No.

40:32.560 --> 40:33.560
No.

40:33.560 --> 40:34.560
No.

40:34.560 --> 40:35.560
No.

40:35.560 --> 40:36.560
Oh.

40:36.560 --> 40:37.560
No.

40:37.560 --> 40:38.560
No.

40:38.560 --> 40:39.560
No.

40:39.560 --> 40:40.560
No.

40:40.560 --> 40:41.560
No.

40:41.560 --> 40:42.560
No.

40:42.560 --> 40:43.560
No.

40:43.560 --> 40:44.560
No.

40:44.560 --> 40:48.560
And they're professionally done by professionals that charge $20,000.

40:48.560 --> 40:49.560
But that's fucking boring.

40:49.560 --> 40:50.560
Well, yeah.

40:50.560 --> 40:52.560
Well, the...

40:57.560 --> 40:58.560
So now, yeah.

40:58.560 --> 41:02.560
So I've got a few wiring down here to change the circuits going over there.

41:02.560 --> 41:05.560
I do want, you know, so that obviously...

41:05.560 --> 41:07.560
So the inverter's on.

41:07.560 --> 41:09.560
Oh yeah, you can see this.

41:10.560 --> 41:11.560
So the inverter's on.

41:11.560 --> 41:13.560
Okay, I got 3,000 watts.

41:13.560 --> 41:14.560
Okay.

41:14.560 --> 41:18.560
By the way, these are like light activated, so if you...

41:18.560 --> 41:19.560
Have you got close to them?

41:19.560 --> 41:21.560
Yeah, well, if you cover up that little sensor.

41:21.560 --> 41:22.560
Yeah, yeah.

41:22.560 --> 41:24.560
And when it's still enough light.

41:24.560 --> 41:26.560
So this is...

41:26.560 --> 41:29.560
I can run my desk on super green alone.

41:29.560 --> 41:30.560
It's kind of nice.

41:30.560 --> 41:31.560
Just the desk, okay?

41:31.560 --> 41:32.560
Sure.

41:32.560 --> 41:34.560
The desk area.

41:34.560 --> 41:36.560
The microwave's running, okay?

41:36.560 --> 41:38.560
And what's that running on right now?

41:38.560 --> 41:39.560
It's running on the inverter.

41:39.560 --> 41:40.560
That's the inverter.

41:40.560 --> 41:41.560
It's running the generator on?

41:41.560 --> 41:42.560
It's draining the batteries.

41:42.560 --> 41:44.560
It was draining the batteries.

41:44.560 --> 41:45.560
No, not yet.

41:45.560 --> 41:46.560
Wait.

41:46.560 --> 41:47.560
The hammer.

41:50.560 --> 41:53.560
Notice the frequency change of the sound.

41:53.560 --> 41:54.560
Switch from 50 to 60.

41:54.560 --> 41:55.560
That time it actually worked.

41:55.560 --> 41:57.560
Sometimes it would go...

41:57.560 --> 41:58.560
I have a little UPS over here.

41:58.560 --> 41:59.560
You may...

41:59.560 --> 42:00.560
I probably had it.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.560
It would totally bonkers out to UPS.

42:02.560 --> 42:08.560
And that led me, like, into all sorts of confusion.

42:08.560 --> 42:09.560
Good name.

42:09.560 --> 42:13.560
So, yeah, so for example, the light upstairs can be turned on.

42:13.560 --> 42:14.560
The lights in the bedroom can be turned on.

42:14.560 --> 42:16.560
The lights in the bathroom can be turned on.

42:16.560 --> 42:19.560
And, you know, we're pretty charged.

42:19.560 --> 42:27.560
Probably out this evening I'll run the portable generator from dark until about 8.39 or shortly

42:27.560 --> 42:28.560
we could go to bed.

42:28.560 --> 42:33.560
I'll turn it off and the internet alone can run overnight.

42:33.560 --> 42:34.560
Just fine.

42:34.560 --> 42:35.560
Not a issue.

42:35.560 --> 42:36.560
Great.

42:36.560 --> 42:37.560
Off the batteries.

42:37.560 --> 42:44.560
And especially now that the nitro is going to be a bit warmer, the batteries will be

42:44.560 --> 42:45.560
able to get more productive.

42:45.560 --> 42:46.560
And that's the system.

42:46.560 --> 42:47.560
Okay, so now we want to draw things out.

42:47.560 --> 42:48.560
Or do we want to do something else?

42:48.560 --> 42:49.560
Oh, yeah.

42:49.560 --> 42:50.560
I can draw things out.

42:50.560 --> 42:51.560
What are people doing?

42:51.560 --> 42:53.560
People are just kind of doing their own thing.

42:53.560 --> 42:58.560
I'm thinking tomorrow when it's a bit warmer, we'll climb Baldy and have a picnic somewhere.

42:58.560 --> 42:59.560
Just that, bro.

42:59.560 --> 43:00.560
Okay.

43:00.560 --> 43:02.560
You've been continuously filming me.

43:02.560 --> 43:03.560
Yeah, this is a 43 minute video.

43:03.560 --> 43:04.560
Are we done with the...

43:04.560 --> 43:06.560
I think we're done with the video.

43:06.560 --> 43:07.560
All right, cool.

43:07.560 --> 43:08.560
Cool.

43:08.560 --> 43:09.560
Nice talking to you all.

43:09.560 --> 43:10.560
Yeah.

43:10.560 --> 43:39.560
Thank you for joining me too, by the way, for when some bozo finds us on gallery in 50 years.
